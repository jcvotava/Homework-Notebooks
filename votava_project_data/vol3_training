"The third volume of the works of Marx and Engels covers the period between March 1843 and August 1844 before their close collaboration began"
"The contents fall into two parts the first consists of Marx ’s works letters and preparatory material from March 1843 to August 1844 the second contains Engels writings from May 1843 to June 1844"
"This period marked an important stage in the formation of the world outlook of both Marx and Engels each of whom accomplished in 1843 the transition from idealism to materialism and from the standpoint of revolutionary democracy to that of communism"
"By late 1843 and early 1844 Marx and Engels were alike opponents not only of the existing political systems of feudal absolutism and bourgeois monarchy but of any kind of social system resting on private property and exploitation of the working people"
"They both saw in the emancipation movement of the working class the only way to free humanity from social inequality and oppression"
"It was at this time that Marx and Engels made their first contacts with the working class"
"After moving to Paris in October 1843"
"Marx found himself in an atmosphere of intense socialist agitation and activity of workers groups and secret societies"
"And during the same year Engels who had been living in England since November 1842 established close links with the Chartists and the Owenite Socialists and became a contributor to their periodicals"
"The main efforts of Marx and Engels during this period were directed towards working out the scientific basis of a new revolutionary proletarian world outlook"
"Each had arrived at materialist and communist convictions and set about studying a broad spectrum of philosophical historical economic and political problems"
"Marx was engaged upon a number of theoretical projects he began writing a work on Hegel ’s philosophy of law intended to write a history of the Convention and was also planning works devoted to the criticism of politics and political economy Engels for his part was studying social developments in England the condition of the English working class"
"Each clearly realised the necessity to dissociate himself from current economic philosophical and sociological doctrines each considered the criticism of these essential if the theoretical principles of a new world outlook were to be arrived at"
"They both clearly understood the inconsistency of Hegel ’s idealism the narrow mindedness of the bourgeois economists and the weaknesses of the Utopian Socialists but at the same time they tried to make use of all that was rational in the views of their predecessors"
"They were deeply impressed by Feuerbach ’s materialism but had already gone far beyond Feuerbach in their approach to theoretical and practical problems particularly in interpreting the life of society"
"The works included in this volume register the completion of Marx ’s and Engels transition to materialism and communism and the initial stage in synthesising the emerging revolutionary communist and dialectical materialist views into a qualitatively new theory"
"The contribution each made to this complex process may be seen"
"Evident too are the common features in their views which led them later to unite their efforts in the theoretical and practical struggle"
"The volume opens with Marx ’s extensive though incomplete manuscript Contribution to the Critique of Hegel ’s Philosophy of Law written in the spring and summer of 1843"
"The object of this study was not only Hegel ’s philosophy"
"All this was reflected in his manuscript and in his notebooks of excerpts the so called Kreuznach Notebooks"
"Although he was strongly influenced by Feuerbach ’s materialism Marx did not approach the criticism of Hegel through an analysis of religion as Feuerbach had done but through an investigation of social relations"
"For this reason what interested Marx most in Hegel was his philosophy of law his teaching on the state and society"
"In the process of criticising Hegel ’s philosophy of law Marx was led to the conclusion that the state is determined by civil society that is the sphere of private first and foremost material interests and the social relations connected with them and not civil society by the state as Hegel had asserted"
"Marx wished to define the concept of civil society in concrete terms to bring out the essential features of its historical evolution and in particular to analyse the stage at which bourgeois private property began to play the dominant role in the field of material relationships"
"Giving a materialist explanation of the mutual connection between the state in his time and bourgeois ownership Marx wrote that the existing political constitution in the developed countries was the constitution of Private Property see this volume p. 98"
"Later in 1859 in the Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy Marx recalled the important part his work on the critique of Hegel ’s philosophy of law had played in the formation of his materialist views My inquiry led me to the conclusion that neither legal relations nor political forms could be comprehended either by themselves or on the basis of a so called general development of the human mind but that on the contrary they originate in the material conditions of life the totality of which Hegel following the example of English and French thinkers of the eighteenth century embraces within the term civil society that the anatomy of this civil society however has to be sought in political economy"
"He arrived at the conviction that idealism inevitably leads to religion and mysticism"
"But Marx did not reject the rational content of Hegel ’s philosophy or his dialectics and stressed that Hegel had succeeded in presenting though in an abstract mystified form many of the real processes of social life"
"Contrary to Feuerbach Marx continued to attach great importance to Hegel ’s dialectical method and made the first step towards a materialist transformation of dialectics towards freeing it from its mystical shell"
"In his manuscript Marx put forward his own essentially communist conception of democracy as a social system free from social oppression and worthy of man"
"We can he stressed acquire genuine freedom by throwing off the impositions of both the bureaucratically organised state and of a civil society resting on the egoistic principles of private property"
"Closely connected with the manuscript of 1843 is Marx ’s note on Hegel taken from the Kreuznach Notebooks which is included in this volume"
"It bears witness to the internal connection between the manuscript and the notebooks which were compiled because Marx felt the necessity to supplement his philosophical investigation with concrete historical material"
"In this note Marx criticises Hegel for separating the abstract idea of the state from its real historical form"
"Marx ’s final transition to the standpoint of communism was associated with the preparation and publication of the journal Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher"
"Marx ’s draft programme of this journal and his correspondence with the co founder the radical philosopher and publicist Arnold Ruge which are included in this volume reflect the different approaches of the editors to the journal ’s tasks"
"Contrary to Ruge who wanted to give it a more moderate purely enlightening character Marx held that the main theme of the journal the purpose of which was to unite the German and French Socialists and democrats should be relentless criticism of the existing world order"
"Accordingly in the letters published in the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher Marx had no use for speculative theories divorced from life and the practical struggle of the masses and demanded the embodiment of theoretical criticism in practical revolutionary activity making"
"He expressed here one of the principal ideas of the emerging revolutionary communist world outlook -the idea of the unity of theory and practice"
"In his article On the Jewish Question Marx attacked Bruno Bauer ’s idealistic narrowly theological presentation of the problem of Jewish emancipation"
"As opposed to his former fellow thinkers the Young Hegelians Marx saw criticism of religion as well as of politics not as the final aim but as a tool to be used in the revolutionary struggle and he wanted to go further and deeper in the critical reconsideration of all existing relationships"
"Marx ’s polemic with Bauer provided him with the occasion for a broader materialist examination of the problem of mankind ’s emancipation not only from national religious and political but also from economic and social oppression"
"In this work Marx developed the concept of the limited nature of the bourgeois revolution which he called political emancipation"
"He put forward the idea of the necessity for a deeper going revolution aiming at the real elimination of all social antagonisms"
"This kind of revolution he called human emancipation"
"In another of his works published in the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher Contribution to the Critique of Hegel ’s Philosophy of Law"
"Introduction Marx continued his analysis of the problem of human emancipation"
"In this work Marx also came to another important conclusion the profound revolutionising significance of advanced theory"
"The weapon of criticism can not of course replace criticism by weapons material force must be overthrown by material force but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses see this volume p. 182"
"Lenin considered Marx ’s articles in the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher as the final link in his transition from revolutionary democracy to proletarian revolution Marx ’s articles in this journal showed that he was already a revolutionary who advocated merciless criticism of everything existing and in particular the criticism by weapons and appealed to the masses and to the proletariat V. I. Lenin Collected Works Vol"
"After the journal Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher ceased publication Marx wrote several articles for Vorw � rts the German emigrants paper in Paris"
"His articles in this newspaper his direct participation in the editorial work from September 1844 and his enlistment of Frederick Engels Heinrich Heine and Georg Herwegh as contributors made this journal a militant political weapon in the struggle against both Prussian absolutism and German moderate liberalism"
"Under the influence of Marx and Engels the paper began to assume a communist character"
"Marx ’s article Critical Marginal Notes on the Article The King of Prussia and Social Reform"
"By a Prussian dealing with the uprising of the Silesian weavers in 1844 was published in Vorw � rts"
"It was directed against Ruge who considered the Silesian uprising a futile revolt of the desperate poor"
"Marx on the other hand regarded it as the first major class action of the German proletariat against the bourgeoisie a testimony to the broad revolutionary possibilities of the working class"
"Developing the idea he had already expressed in the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher about the world historical role of the proletariat Marx pointed out that it is only in the proletariat that the German people can find the dynamic element of its emancipation see this volume p. 202"
"Having arrived at a materialist position Marx came to the conclusion that an extensive study of economic relations had to be undertaken"
"From this time until the end of his life the study of political economy occupied the central place in his scientific activity"
"Marx made numerous excerpts from the works of Adam Smith Ricardo Say Skarbek List James Mill Destutt de Tracy McCulloch Boisguillebert Lauderdale Sch � tz and other economists"
"in many cases accompanying these excerpts with his own comments and critical remarks"
"The most extensive of these are the Comments on James Mill"
"� l � mens d' � conomie politique which formed part of Marx ’s summary of this work and are included in the present volume"
"From these comments it is clear that although Marx ’s own economic views were still in the initial stage of formation he nevertheless succeeded in noting the main defect of bourgeois political economy its anti historical approach to capitalism"
"He pointed out that Mill like other bourgeois economists thought capitalist relations eternal and immutable corresponding to man ’s nature see this volume p. 217"
"Many of the thoughts expressed in the Comments have much in common with the unfinished only partially extant work which has editorially been given the title Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844"
"This was Marx ’s first attempt at a critical examination from the standpoint of the dialectical materialist and communist conclusions he had reached of the economic bases of bourgeois society and the views of the bourgeois economists"
"At the same time these manuscripts were the first attempt of synthesising the new philosophical economic and historical political ideas of the integral world outlook of the proletariat"
"The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 embrace various fields of the social sciences"
"In all these fields Marx used and developed materialist dialectics as a penetrative instrument of knowledge"
"He achieved a new stage of comprehension of the structure and development of society"
"Marx emphasised here for the first time the decisive role of production in the social process and pointed out that private property and the division of labour are the material basis of society ’s division into classes"
"Analysing the economic structure of bourgeois society he stressed that the class contradictions of capitalism would inevitably grow deeper as wealth became concentrated in the hands of capitalist owners"
"Extremely penetrating are Marx ’s thoughts on the influence of man ’s productive labour and his social relations on science and culture"
"He noted in particular the process not only of social enslavement but also of spiritual impoverishment of the working man resulting from the domination of private property"
"In his manuscripts Marx put forward materialist criteria for assessing the development of economic thought a development which he explained is a reflection in the ideological sphere of the evolution of actual economic relations"
"The development of science according to Marx repeats the development of society itself"
"He considered the teaching of the leading bourgeois economists Adam Smith Ricardo and others as the highest achievement of political economy"
"But although he had not yet undertaken an analysis of the labour theory of value he at the same time noted the limitations of their views their failure to understand the true internal connections and dynamics of the economic phenomena described and their metaphysical approach to them"
"In their striving to perpetuate artificially the basis of capitalism and the relationships of inhuman exploitation Marx discerned the anti humanist tendencies of the bourgeois economists"
"In the manuscripts of 1844 as in his other works of this period Marx used the traditional terminology partly of Feuerbach and partly of Hegel"
"Thus in accordance with Feuerbach ’s usage Marx wrote that communism as fully developed naturalism equals humanism and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism"
"In fact however Marx gave these terms an essentially new content and put forward views which were in many respects opposed to Feuerbach ’s abstract humanism and supra class anti historical anthropologism"
"His manuscripts are pervaded with the sense of history and understanding of the significance of revolutionary practice and are distinguished by their class approach to the social phenomena under consideration"
"As regards Hegel it can be seen from the manuscripts of 1844 that Marx had achieved a quite mature understanding of the relationship between the rational and conservative aspects of his teaching"
"Marx showed the groundlessness of Hegel ’s attempts to transform nature into another mode of existence of the mystical Absolute Idea"
"One of the central problems in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 is the problem of estrangement or alienation"
"With him however it is not real living people but the Absolute Idea that undergoes alienation"
"Feuerbach operates with a similar concept in his theory of the origin of religion reducing it to the alienation of the universal generic qualities of abstract man which are imputed to an illusory divinity"
"Marx used the concept of alienation for purposes of a profound analysis of social relations"
"For him alienation was characteristic of those social relations under which the conditions of people ’s life and activity that activity itself and the relations between people appear as a force which is alien and hostile to people"
"So in Marx ’s interpretation alienation is by no means a supra-:historical phenomenon"
"He saw that alienation could be overcome only by the liquidation of private property and of all the consequences of its domination"
"Marx ’s views on alienation appeared in a concentrated form in his treatment of estranged labour"
"The concept of estranged labour summed up the enslaved condition of the worker in capitalist society his being tied down to a definite job his physical and moral crippling as a result of labour which is forced on him the loss of his self see this volume p. 274"
"The concept of estranged labour in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 constituted in particular the initial expression of the future Marxist theory of the appropriation of labour of others by capital a preliminary approach to the important ideas later developed especially in Capital"
"In his subsequent works this concept was superseded to a considerable degree by other more concrete determinations revealing more completely and more clearly the substance of the economic relations of capitalism the exploitation of wage labour"
"However as a philosophically generalised expression of the exploiting inhuman character of the social system based on private property and of the destitution of the working masses in that society it continues to be used in Marx ’s later works"
"In order to abolish the idea of private property the idea of communism is quite sufficient"
"As Marx saw it the future social system represents the antipode of the existing society of exploitation"
"At that stage of social development man will have become capable of freeing himself from social antagonisms and all forms of alienation"
"Marx criticised the various primitive theories of egalitarian communism with their tendencies towards asceticism social levelling and a return to the unnatural simplicity of the poor and crude man who has few needs see this volume p. 295"
"The second section of the first part of this volume contains letters written by Marx which provide supplementary material showing the development of his views and his political activity during the period"
"Of special interest are two letters from Marx to Ludwig Feuerbach"
"Marx wanted to draw the great materialist philosopher into active political and"
"In his letter of October 3 1843 inviting Feuerbach to contribute to the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher Marx mentioned how important it would be if his authority as a philosopher could be used to discredit Schelling ’s reactionary and idealist philosophy"
"The idea that philosophical materialism and idealism are irreconcilable likewise runs through another letter written on August 11 1844"
"In it Marx stressed that progressive philosophy should serve the most revolutionary social force the proletariat"
"At that time Marx still regarded Feuerbach ’s materialism as the theoretical substantiation of the necessity for the revolutionary transformation of society"
"He considered that Feuerbach had provided a philosophical basis for socialism see this volume p. 354"
"However it soon became obvious to Marx that such a foundation could be laid only by overcoming the weak sides of Feuerbach ’s philosophy with its tendency towards abstraction from real social relations and by working out a theory that would reveal the objective dialectical laws of social development"
"The section From the Preparatory Materials contains a conspectus of the memoirs of the Jacobin Levasseur made by Marx after his move to Paris most probably in connection with his unrealised intention to write a history of the Convention"
"This conspectus entitled by Marx The Struggle Between the Montagnards and the Girondists demonstrates Marx ’s sustained interest in the French Revolution of the late eighteenth century as a major event of world history"
"It contains few of Marx ’s own remarks but the selection of the material shows that he was particularly interested in the influence of the popular masses on the course of the Revolution"
"It was precisely the growing revolutionary activity of the masses after the fall of the monarchy on August 10 1792 and their increasing discontent with the administration of the Girondists who represented the moderate bourgeoisie as the facts quoted by Marx eloquently prove -that led to the establishment of the revolutionary dictatorship of the Jacobins"
"His study of these events undoubtedly played a major part in the formation of his views of the determining role of the working masses in history and the class struggle as the most important factor in historical development"
"This section also includes a short summary made by Marx of Engels article Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy"
"This article was one of the causes which led Marx to study political economy"
"Marx recognised in Engels a philosophical and political fellow thinker and was deeply influenced by Engels initiative in dealing with problems of economics from the standpoint of communism a field in which his future associate was then a pioneer"
"The second part of the volume contains the works of Engels written from May 1843 to June 1844"
"Living in England the most highly developed capitalist country of the time Engels studied with a profound interest its economic and political life and social relations"
"He devoted himself especially to the study of British political economy and the works of the English Utopian Socialists in particular Robert Owen"
"In analysing it Engels laid bare the class character of the English political parties"
"He noted the important role of the Socialist and Chartist movements and stressed that Chartism has its strength in the working men the proletarians see this volume p. 379"
"The Letters from London mark a new stage in the development of Engels revolutionary materialist world outlook since his arrival in England in the autumn of 1842"
"Engels himself thought it his duty to inform the English Chartists and Owenists about the socialist and communist movements in other countries"
"For this purpose he wrote a number of articles for the"
"The New Moral World including the essay Progress of Social Reform on the Continent"
"Engels linked the inception and development of socialist and communist teachings with the social protest of the working masses against oppress on and exploitation and showed that socialist views came into being as a reflection of that protest in the consciousness of progressive thinkers"
"Drawing attention to the common underlying social base and international character of the socialist and communist movement he wrote"
"Communism is not the consequence of the particular position of the English or any other nation but a necessary conclusion which can not be avoided to be drawn from the premises given in the general facts of modern civilisation see this volume p. 392"
"At the same time he noted the influence of each people ’s national peculiarities on the development of socialist thought"
"Engels followed the history of socialist and communist ideas in France Germany and Switzerland"
"He brought out the rational elements in the teaching of the various schools of utopian socialism and communism and at the same time he indicated the inconsistencies and immature features inherent in them"
"The article shows that he was clearly aware of the need to overcome the defects of previous socialist ideas to deepen the theoretical understanding of communism and unite it with advanced philosophy"
"The article Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy published in the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher was Engels first work on economics"
"In it Lenin wrote he examined the principal phenomena of the contemporary economic order from a socialist standpoint regarding them as necessary consequences of the rule of private property V. I. Lenin Collected Works Vol 2 p. 24"
"Engels work is remarkable for its profound revolutionary purposefulness its materialist proletarian class approach to economic phenomena and theories and its clear understanding of the failure of the metaphysical method used by the bourgeois economists"
"His article was the first experiment in applying the materialist world outlook and materialist dialectics to the analysis of economic categories"
"The work is devoted mainly to a critical examination of the economic basis of the capitalist system private property"
"Engels proved that the main cause of the social antagonisms in the bourgeois world and the cause of the future social revolution was the development of the contradictions inherent in and engendered by private property"
"He investigated the dialectical interconnections between competition and monopoly resulting from the nature of private property and the profound contradictions between labour and capital"
"While criticising the bourgeois economists Engels made no distinction at that time between the representatives of the classical school Smith and Ricardo and vulgar economists of the type of Say McCulloch and others"
"At this stage he had not yet accepted Smith ’s and Ricardo ’s labour theory of value and was unable properly to assess its place in the development of economic teachings"
"At the same time he put forward the profound concept of the correspondence between the development of political economy and the level of economic relations achieved"
"He vehemently criticised the unscientific misanthropic population theory of Malthus and proved that poverty and destitution are in no way to be accounted for by allegedly limited possibilities of production and of applied science"
"On the contrary Engels stressed that the productive power at mankind ’s disposal is immeasurable see this volume p. 436"
"Social calamities he concluded are engendered by the existing economic system which must be subjected to a revolutionary communist reconstruction"
"Engels Review also published in the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher of Carlyle ’s Past and Present which he criticised from the standpoint of materialism and atheism took issue with Carlyle ’s idealist interpretation of history his hero worship and romantic idealisation of the Middle Ages"
"In opposition to these views Engels emphasised that at the basis of the historical process lies the concrete activity of people their hard struggle both to subjugate nature and to establish social relationships corresponding to man ’s dignity and genuine interest"
"He expressed faith in the creative role of the proletariat in its ability to carry out radical social changes"
"In the articles continuing this review and published in the newspaper Vorw � rts The Condition of England"
"The Eighteenth Century and The Condition of England"
"Engels performed pioneering work in the materialist interpretation of the history of England and this Was a most important premise for the subsequent elaboration by Marx and Engels of the materialist understanding of the whole historical process"
"Engels traced the part played by the industrial revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in England ’s development and analysed in detail its social and political consequences"
"Examining the English political system he showed the limitations of bourgeois democracy"
"Opposing to it the idea of social democracy Engels arrived at the conclusion that the conquest of political power by the working class was the necessary condition for the transition to socialism"
"This volume contains a large group of articles previously unknown as written by Engels from the Chartist paper The Northern Star to which he began to contribute at the end of 1843"
"They had a common theme the democratic and socialist movement in the countries of Central Europe and exposure of the reactionary policy pursued by the governments of those states"
"Engels demonstrated the common condition of the working class in different countries and the identity of the social causes giving rise to the class actions of the workers"
"Particularly notable are the articles News from Prussia and Further Particulars of the Silesian Riots because they are the first comments on the uprising of the Silesian weavers from the standpoint of revolutionary communism"
"Engels saw in the uprising the confirmation of the universal character of the contradictions of capitalism and pointed out that the emergence of the factory system would have the same effects in every country as it had in England"
"The account of the Silesian uprising in these articles coincided in many respects with Marx ’s assessment of it in his work Critical Marginal Notes on the Article The King of Prussia and Social Reform"
"The evolution of Engels views led him to the same conclusions at which Marx was arriving"
"The ensuing steps in developing the scientific principles of the revolutionary world outlook were made by them jointly in their unique collaboration which began after their meeting in Paris at the end of August 1844"
"The works of Engels not previously published in English include the first three articles in the series Letters from London and one article in the series The Condition of England"
"The eleven articles from the newspaper"
"The Northern Star have been collected together for the first time"
"Peculiarities in the arrangement of the text of some works in particular the manuscripts are described in the notes"
"Certain changes have been introduced in the translation and some passages retranslated to render Marx ’s interpretation of the respective passages"
"All the texts have been translated from the German except where otherwise indicated"
"The volume was compiled and the preface and notes written by Velta Pospelova and edited by Lev Golman Institute of Marxism Leninism of the CC CPSU"

"Passage from The Kreuznach Notebooks of 1843"
"written by Marx in July August 1843 in connection with his reading and summarising of the journal Historisch politische Zeitschrift edited by Leopold Ranke"
"Marx was particularly interested in Ranke 's article � ber die restauration in Frankreich"
"This note was found in the fourth Kreuznach Notebook which contains Marx 's historical excerpts relating to July August 1843 and are directly connected to his Critique of Hegel 's Philosophy of Right"
"July August 1843 Source Marx Engels Collected Works Volume 3"
"Under Louis XVIII the constitution by grace of the king Charter imposed by the king under Louis Philippe the king by grace of the constitution imposed kingship"
"In general we can note that the conversion of the subject into the predicate and of the predicate into the subject the exchange of that which determines for that which is determined is always the most immediate revolution"
"Not only on the revolutionary side"
"The king makes the law old monarchy the law makes the king new monarchy"
"The reactionaries as well"
"Primogeniture is the law of the state"
"The state demands the law of primogeniture"
"Owing to the fact therefore that Hegel makes the elements of the state idea the subject and the old forms of existence of the state the predicate whereas in historical reality the reverse is the case the state idea being instead the predicate of those forms of existence he expresses only the general character of the period its political teleology"
"It is the same thing as with his philosophical religious pantheism"
"By means of it all forms of unreason become forms of reason"
"But essentially here in religion reason is made the determining factor while in the state the idea of the state is made the determining factor"
"This metaphysics is the metaphysical expression of reaction of the old world as the truth of the new world outlook"

"First Published in Deutsch Frans � siche Jahrb � cher 1844"
"These letters written by Marx form part of his correspondence with Ruge at the time of their preparations for publishing the journal Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher they were published in the journal in the section From the Correspondence of 1843 where letters by Ruge Bakunin and Feuerbach were also printed"
"In these letters Marx in fact formulated his revolutionary views on the programme of the journal which went further than the tasks of disseminating abstract philosophical ideas and bourgeois democratic political views set by its other editor Ruge"
"Marx ’s letters to Ruge from the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher were first published in English in the book Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society New York 1967"
"Despite considerable organisational and material difficulties the journal was edited in Paris and printed in Zurich"
"the editorial board managed to put out the first double issue No 1 2 of the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher at the end of February 1844"
"The main trend of the journal was determined by Marx ’s letters and articles On the Jewish"
"Question Contribution to the Critique of Hegel ’s Philosophy of Law"
"Introduction and Engels articles Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy"
"The Condition of England"
"Past and Present by Thomas Carlyle which were published in it and were imbued with revolutionary communist spirit"
"However the publication of the journal was discontinued"
"By its sharp political presentation of material the Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher attracted the attention of the progressive sections of society in Germany France and other countries but at the same time evoked indignation of the conservative press"
"The Prussian Government considered the political line of the journal extremely dangerous banned its import to Germany and issued warrants for the arrest of Marx Ruge Heine and the other contributors in the event of their coming to Prussia"
"About two thirds out of the total of three thousand copies fell into the hands of the police"

"See Citizen in the Encyclopedia of Marxism for an explanation of the various words for citizen"
"The German Jews desire emancipation"
"What kind of emancipation do they desire"
"We ourselves are not free"
"How are we to free you"
"You Jews are egoists if you demand a special emancipation for yourselves as Jews"
"As Germans you ought to work for the political emancipation of Germany and as human beings for the emancipation of mankind and you should feel the particular kind of your oppression and your shame not as an exception to the rule but on the contrary as a confirmation of the rule"
"Or do the Jews demand the same status as Christian subjects of the state"
"Why should they disapprove of their special yoke if they approve of the general yoke"
"Why should the German be interested in the liberation of the Jew if the Jew is not interested in the liberation of the German"
"The Christian state knows only privileges"
"In this state the Jew has the privilege of being a Jew"
"As a Jew he has rights which the Christians do not have"
"Why should he want rights which he does not have but which the Christians enjoy"
"In wanting to be emancipated from the Christian state the Jew is demanding that the Christian state should give up its religious prejudice"
"Does he the Jew give up his religious prejudice"
"Has he then the right to demand that someone else should renounce his religion"
"By its very nature the Christian state is incapable of emancipating the Jew but adds Bauer by his very nature the Jew can not be emancipated"
"So long as the state is Christian and the Jew is Jewish the one is as incapable of granting emancipation as the other is of receiving it"
"The Christian state can behave towards the Jew only in the way characteristic of the Christian state that is by granting privileges by permitting the separation of the Jew from the other subjects but making him feel the pressure of all the other separate spheres of society and feel it all the more intensely because he is in religious opposition to the dominant religion"
"But the Jew too can behave towards the state only in a Jewish way that is by treating it as something alien to him by counterposing his imaginary nationality to the real nationality by counterposing his illusory law to the real law by deeming himself justified in separating himself from mankind by abstaining on principle from taking part in the historical movement by putting his trust in a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind in general and by seeing himself as a member of the Jewish people and the Jewish people as the chosen people"
"On what grounds then do you Jews want emancipation"
"It is the mortal enemy of the state religion"
"In Germany there are no citizens"
"But you are no more human beings than those to whom you appeal"
"Bauer has posed the question of Jewish emancipation in a new form after giving a critical analysis of the previous formulations and solutions of the question"
"What he asks is the nature of the Jew who is to be emancipated and of the Christian state that is to emancipate him"
"He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion he analyzes the religious opposition between Judaism and Christianity he elucidates the essence of the Christian state and he does all this audaciously trenchantly wittily and with profundity in a style of writing that is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous"
"How then does Bauer solve the Jewish question"
"What is the result"
"The formulation of a question is its solution"
"The critique of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question"
"The summary therefore is as follows"
"The most rigid form of the opposition between the Jew and the Christian is the religious opposition"
"How is an opposition resolved"
"By making it impossible"
"How is religious opposition made impossible"
"As soon as Jew and Christian recognize that their respective religions are no more than different stages in the development of the human mind different snake skins cast off by history and that man is the snake who sloughed them the relation of Jew and Christian is no longer religious but is only a critical scientific and human relation"
"Science then constitutes their unity"
"But contradictions in science are resolved by science itself"
"In Bauer ’s conception however the Jewish question has a universal significance independent of specifically German conditions"
"It is the question of the relation of religion to the state of the contradiction between religious constraint and political emancipation"
"Emancipation from religion is laid down as a condition both to the Jew who wants to be emancipated politically and to the state which is to effect emancipation and is itself to be emancipated"
"Very well it is said and the Jew himself says it the Jew is to become emancipated not as a Jew not because he is a Jew not because he possesses such an excellent universally human principle of morality"
"on the contrary the Jew will retreat behind the citizen and be a citizen although he is a Jew and is to remain a Jew"
"That is to say he is and remains a Jew although he is a citizen and lives in universally human conditions his Jewish and restricted nature triumphs always in the end over his human and political obligations"
"The prejudice remains in spite of being outstripped by general principles"
"But if it remains then on the contrary it outstrips everything else"
"Only sophistically only apparently would the Jew be able to remain a Jew in the life of the state"
"The Capacity of Present Day Jews and Christians to Become Free Einundzwanzig Bogen pp 57"
"Let us hear on the other hand how Bauer presents the task of the state"
"France he says has recently shown us Proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies December 26 1840"
"in the connection with the Jewish question just as it has continually done in all other political questions the spectacle of a life which is free but which revokes its freedom by law hence declaring it to be an appearance and on the other hand contradicting its free laws by its action"
"The Jewish Question p. 64"
"In France universal freedom is not yet the law the Jewish question too has not yet been solved because legal freedom the fact that all citizens are equal is restricted in actual life which is still dominated and divided by religious privileges and this lack of freedom in actual life reacts on law and compels the latter to sanction the division of the citizens who as such are free into oppressed and oppressors"
"When therefore would the Jewish question be solved for France"
"The Jew for example would have ceased to be a Jew if he did not allow himself to be prevented by his laws from fulfilling his duty to the state and his fellow citizens that is for example if on the Sabbath he attended the Chamber of Deputies and took part in the official proceedings"
"Every religious privilege and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church would have been abolished altogether and if some or many persons or even the overwhelming majority still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter"
"There is no longer any religion when there is no longer any privileged religion"
"Take from religion its exclusive power and it will no longer exist"
"p. 66 Just as M. Martin du Nord saw the proposal to omit mention of Sunday in the law as a motion to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist with equal reason and this reason is very well founded"
"the declaration that the law of the Sabbath is no longer binding on the Jew would be a proclamation abolishing Judaism"
"p. 71 Bauer therefore demands on the one hand that the Jew should renounce Judaism and that mankind in general should renounce religion in order to achieve civic emancipation"
"On the other hand he quite consistently regards the political abolition of religion as the abolition of religion as such"
"The state which presupposes religion is not yet a true real state"
"Of course the religious notion affords security to the state"
"But to what state"
"To what kind of state"
"At this point the one sided formulation of the Jewish question becomes evident"
"It was by no means sufficient to investigate"
"Who is to emancipate"
"Who is to be emancipated"
"Criticism had to investigate a third point"
"It had to inquire What kind of emancipation is in question"
"What conditions follow from the very nature of the emancipation that is demanded"
"Only the criticism of political emancipation itself would have been the conclusive criticism of the Jewish question and its real merging in the general question of time"
"Because Bauer does not raise the question to this level he becomes entangled in contradictions"
"He puts forward conditions which are not based on the nature of political emancipation itself"
"He raises questions which are not part of his problem and he solves problems which leave this question unanswered"
"When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation Their error was only that they assumed the Christian state to be the only true one and did not subject it to the same criticism that they applied to Judaism"
"cit p. 3 we find that his error lies in the fact that he subjects to criticism only the Christian state not the state as such that he does not investigate the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation and therefore puts forward conditions which can be explained only by uncritical confusion of political emancipation with general human emancipation"
"If Bauer asks the Jews Have you from your standpoint the right to want political emancipation"
"We ask the converse question"
"Does the standpoint of political emancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion"
"The Jewish question acquires a different form depending on the state in which the Jew lives"
"In Germany where there is no political state no state as such the Jewish question is a purely theological one"
"The Jew finds himself in religious opposition to the state which recognizes Christianity as its basis"
"This state is a theologian ex professo"
"Hence we continue to operate in the sphere of theology however much we may operate critically within it"
"In France a constitutional state the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism the question of the incompleteness of political emancipation"
"Since the semblance of a state religion is retained here although in a meaningless and self contradictory formula that of a religion of the majority the relation of the Jew to the state retains the semblance of a religious theological opposition"
"Only in the North American states at least in some of them does the Jewish question lose its theological significance and become a really secular question"
"Only where the political state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew and of the religious man in general to the political state and therefore the relation of religion to the state show itself in its specific character in its purity"
"The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism as soon as the state ceases to adopt a theological attitude toward religion as soon as it behaves towards religion as a state i.e. politically"
"Criticism then becomes criticism of the political state"
"At this point where the question ceases to be theological Bauer ’s criticism ceases to be critical"
"In the United States there is neither a state religion nor a religion declared to be that of the majority nor the predominance of one cult over another"
"The state stands aloof from all cults"
"Marie ou l’esclavage aux Etats Unis etc by G. de Beaumont Paris 1835 p. 214"
"Indeed there are some North American states where the constitution does not impose any religious belief or religious practice as a condition of political rights"
"Nevertheless in the United States people do not believe that a man without religion could be an honest man"
"Nevertheless North America is pre eminently the country of religiosity as Beaumont Tocqueville and the Englishman Hamilton unanimously assure us"
"The North American states however serve us only as an example"
"If we find that even in the country of complete political emancipation religion not only exists but displays a fresh and vigorous vitality that is proof that the existence of religion is not in contradiction to the perfection of the state"
"Since however the existence of religion is the existence of defect the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself"
"We no longer regard religion as the cause but only as the manifestation of secular narrowness"
"Therefore we explain the religious limitations of the free citizen by their secular limitations"
"We do not assert that they must overcome their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular restrictions we assert that they will overcome their religious narrowness once they get rid of their secular restrictions"
"We do not turn secular questions into theological ones"
"History has long enough been merged in superstition we now merge superstition in history"
"The question of the relation of political emancipation to religion becomes for us the question of the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation"
"We criticize the religious weakness of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular form apart from its weaknesses as regards religion"
"The contradiction between the state and a particular religion for instance Judaism is given by us a human form as the contradiction between the state and particular secular elements the contradiction between the state and religion in general as the contradiction between the state and its presuppositions in general"
"The political emancipation of the Jew the Christian and in general of religious man is the emancipation of the state from Judaism from Christianity from religion in general"
"In its own form in the manner characteristic of its nature the state as a state emancipates itself from religion by emancipating itself from the state religion that is to say by the state as a state not professing any religion but on the contrary asserting itself as a state"
"The political emancipation from religion is not a religious emancipation that has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction because political emancipation is not a form of human emancipation which has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction"
"The limits of political emancipation are evident at once from the fact that the state can free itself from a restriction without man being really free from this restriction that the state can be a free state pun on word Freistaat which also means republic without man being a free man"
"Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he lays down the following condition for political emancipation Every religious privilege and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church would have been abolished altogether and if some or many persons or even the overwhelming majority still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter"
"The Jewish Question p. 65"
"But the attitude of the state and of the republic free state in particular to religion is after all only the attitude to religion of the men who compose the state"
"It follows from this that man frees himself through the medium of the state that he frees himself politically from a limitation when in contradiction with himself he raises himself above this limitation in an abstract limited and partial way"
"It follows further that by freeing himself politically man frees himself in a roundabout way through an intermediary although an essential intermediary"
"It follows finally that man even if he proclaims himself an atheist through the medium of the state that is if he proclaims the state to be atheist still remains in the grip of religion precisely because he acknowledges himself only by a roundabout route only through an intermediary"
"Religion is precisely the recognition of man in a roundabout way through an intermediary"
"The state is the intermediary between man and man ’s freedom"
"Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man transfers the burden of all his divinity all his religious constraint so the state is the intermediary to whom man transfers all his non divinity and all his human unconstraint"
"The political elevation of man above religion shares all the defects and all the advantages of political elevation in general"
"The state as a state annuls for instance private property man declares by political means that private property is abolished as soon as the property qualification for the right to elect or be elected is abolished as has occurred in many states of North America"
"Hamilton quite correctly interprets this fact from a political point of view as meaning"
"Thomas Hamilton Men and Manners in America 2 vols Edinburgh 1833 p. 146 Is not private property abolished in idea if the non property owner has become the legislator for the property owner"
"The property qualification for the suffrage is the last political form of giving recognition to private property"
"Nevertheless the political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it"
"The state abolishes in its own way distinctions of birth social rank education occupation when it declares that birth social rank education occupation are non political distinctions when it proclaims without regard to these distinction that every member of the nation is an equal participant in national sovereignty when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state"
"Nevertheless the state allows private property education occupation to act in their way i.e. as private property as education as occupation and to exert the influence of their special nature"
"Far from abolishing these real distinctions the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being"
"Hegel therefore defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says In order"
"that the state should come into existence as the self knowing moral reality of the mind its distraction from the form of authority and faith is essential"
"But this distinction emerges only insofar as the ecclesiastical aspect arrives at a separation within itself"
"The perfect political state is by its nature man ’s species life as opposed to his material life"
"All the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the sphere of the state but as qualities of civil society"
"Where the political state has attained its true development man not only in thought in consciousness but in reality in life leads a twofold life a heavenly and an earthly life life in the political community in which he considers himself a communal being and life in civil society in which he acts as a private individual regards other men as a means degrades himself into a means and becomes the plaything of alien powers"
"The relation of the political state to civil society is just as spiritual as the relations of heaven to earth"
"The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society and it prevails over the latter in the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world i.e. by likewise having always to acknowledge it to restore it and allow itself to be dominated by it"
"In his most immediate reality in civil society man is a secular being"
"Here where he regards himself as a real individual and is so regarded by others he is a fictitious phenomenon"
"In the state on the other hand where man is regarded as a species being he is the imaginary member of an illusory sovereignty is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality"
"Man as the adherent of a particular religion finds himself in conflict with his citizenship and with other men as members of the community"
"This conflict reduces itself to the secular division between the political state and civil society"
"For man as a bourgeois i.e. as a member of civil society bourgeois society in German life in the state is only a semblance or a temporary exception to the essential and the rule"
"Of course the bourgeois like the Jew remains only sophistically in the sphere of political life just as the citoyen citizen in French i.e. the participant in political life only sophistically remains a Jew or a bourgeois"
"But this sophistry is not personal"
"It is the sophistry of the political state itself"
"The difference between the merchant and the citizen Staatsbürger between the day laborer and the citizen between the landowner and the citizen between the merchant and the citizen between the living individual and the citizen"
"The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man is the same contradiction in which the bourgeois finds himself with the citoyen and the member of civil society with his political lion ’s skin"
"This secular conflict to which the Jewish question ultimately reduces itself the relation between the political state and its preconditions whether these are material elements such as private property etc or spiritual elements such as culture or religion the conflict between the general interest and private interest the schism between the political state and civil society these secular antitheses Bauer allows to persist whereas he conducts a polemic against their religious expression"
"It is precisely the basis of civil society the need that ensures the continuance of this society and guarantees its necessity which exposes its existence to continual dangers maintains in it an element of uncertainty and produces that continually changing mixture of poverty and riches of distress and prosperity and brings about change in general"
"Compare the whole section Civil Society pp 8 9 which has been drawn up along the basic lines of Hegel ’s philosophy of law"
"Civil society in its opposition to the political state is recognized as necessary because the political state is recognized as necessary"
"Political emancipation is of course a big step forward"
"True it is not the final form of human emancipation in general but it is the final form of human emancipation within the hitherto existing world order"
"It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real practical emancipation"
"Man emancipates himself politically from religion by banishing it from the sphere of public law to that of private law"
"Religion is no longer the spirit of the state in which man behaves although in a limited way in a particular form and in a particular sphere as a species being in community with other men"
"Religion has become the spirit of civil society of the sphere of egoism of bellum omnium contra omnes"
"It is no longer the essence of community but the essence of difference"
"It has become the expression of man ’s separation from his community from himself and from other men as it was originally"
"It is only the abstract avowal of specific perversity private whimsy and arbitrariness"
"The endless fragmentation of religion in North America for example gives it even externally the form of a purely individual affair"
"It has been thrust among the multitude of private interests and ejected from the community as such"
"But one should be under no illusion about the limits of political emancipation"
"The division of the human being into a public man and a private man the displacement of religion from the state into civil society this is not a stage of political emancipation but its completion this emancipation therefore neither abolished the real religiousness of man nor strives to do so"
"The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen Protestant and citizen religious man and citizen is neither a deception directed against citizenhood nor is it a circumvention of political emancipation it is political emancipation itself the political method of emancipating oneself from religion"
"But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property to the maximum to confiscation to progressive taxation just as it goes as far as the abolition of life the guillotine"
"At times of special self confidence political life seeks to suppress its prerequisite civil society and the elements composing this society and to constitute itself as the real species life of man devoid of contradictions"
"But it can achieve this only by coming into violent contradiction with its own conditions of life only by declaring the revolution to be permanent and therefore the political drama necessarily ends with the re establishment of religion private property and all elements of civil society just as war ends with peace"
"Indeed the perfect Christian state is not the so called Christian state which acknowledges Christianity as its basis as the state religion and therefore adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions"
"On the contrary the perfect Christian state is the atheistic state the democratic state the state which relegates religion to a place among the other elements of civil society"
"The state which is still theological which still officially professes Christianity as its creed which still does not dare to proclaim itself as a state has in its reality as a state not yet succeeded in expressing the human basis of which Christianity is the high flown expression in a secular human form"
"The so called Christian state is simply nothing more than a non state since it is not Christianity as a religion but only the human background of the Christian religion which can find its expression in actual human creations"
"The state which still professes Christianity in the form of religion does not yet profess it in the form appropriate to the state for it still has a religious attitude towards religion"
"The so called Christian state is the imperfect state and the Christian religion is regarded by it as the supplementation and sanctification of its imperfection"
"For the Christian state therefore religion necessarily becomes a means hence it is a hypocritical state"
"It makes a great difference whether the complete state because of the defect inherent in the general nature of the state counts religion among its presuppositions or whether the incomplete state because of the defect inherent in its particular existence as a defective state declares that religion is its basis"
"In the former case the imperfection even of consummate politics becomes evident in religion"
"The so called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself as a state"
"The democratic state the real state does not need religion for its political completion"
"On the contrary it can disregard religion because in it the human basis of religion is realized in a secular manner"
"By degrading the forms of the state to mere semblance it equally degrades religion to mere semblance"
"Recently says Bauer in order to prove the impossibility or non existence of a Christian state reference has frequently been made to those sayings in the Gospel with which the present day state not only does not comply but can not possibly comply if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state"
"But the matter can not be disposed of so easily"
"What do these Gospel sayings demand"
"Supernatural renunciation of self submission to the authority of revelation a turning away from the state the abolition of secular conditions"
"Well the Christian state demands and accomplishes all that"
"It has assimilated the spirit of the Gospel and if it does not reproduce this spirit in the same terms as the Gospel that occurs only because it expresses this spirit in political forms i.e. in forms which it is true are taken from the political system in this world but which in the religious rebirth that they have to undergo become degraded to a mere semblance"
"This is a turning away from the state while making use of political forms for its realization"
"p. 55 Bauer then explains that the people of a Christian state is only a non people no longer having a will of its own but whose true existence lies in the leader to whom it is subjected although this leader by his origin and nature is alien to it i.e. given by God and imposed on the people without any co operation on its part"
"Bauer declares that the laws of such a people are not its own creation but are actual revelations that its supreme chief needs privileged intermediaries with the people in the strict sense with the masses and that the masses themselves are divided into a multitude of particular groupings which are formed and determined by chance which are differentiated by their interests their particular passions and prejudices and obtain permission as a privilege to isolate themselves from one another etc"
"However Bauer himself says Politics if it is to be nothing but religion ought not to be politics just as the cleaning of saucepans if it is to be accepted as a religious matter ought not to be regarded as a matter of domestic economy"
"In the Christian German state however religion is an economic matter just as economic matters belong to the sphere of religion"
"The domination of religion in the Christian German state is the religion of domination"
"The separation of the spirit of the Gospel from the letter of the Gospel is an irreligious act"
"A state which makes the Gospel speak in the language of politics that is in another language than that of the Holy Ghost commits sacrilege if not in human eyes then in the eyes of its own religion"
"The state which acknowledges Christianity as its supreme criterion and the Bible as its Charter must be confronted with the words of Holy Scripture for every word of Scripture is holy"
"This state as well as the human rubbish on which it is based is caught in a painful contradiction that is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness when it is referred to those sayings of the Gospel with which it not only does not comply but can not possibly comply if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state"
"And why does it not want to dissolve itself completely"
"The state itself can not give an answer either to itself or to others"
"In its own consciousness the official Christian state is an imperative the realization of which is unattainable the state can assert the reality of its existence only by lying to itself and therefore always remains in its own eyes an object of doubt an unreliable problematic object"
"Criticism is therefore fully justified in forcing the state that relies on the Bible into a mental derangement in which it no longer knows whether it is an illusion or a reality and in which the infamy of its secular aims for which religion serves as a cloak comes into insoluble conflict with the sincerity of its religious consciousness for which religion appears as the aim of the world"
"This state can only save itself from its inner torment if it becomes the police agent of the Catholic Church"
"In relation to the church which declares the secular power to be its servant the state is powerless the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit is powerless"
"It is indeed estrangement which matters in the so called Christian state but not man"
"The only man who counts the king is a being specifically different from other men and is moreover a religious being directly linked with heaven with God"
"The relationships which prevail here are still relationships dependent of faith"
"The religious spirit therefore is still not really secularized"
"But furthermore the religious spirit can not be really secularized for what is it in itself"
"but the non secular form of a stage in the development of the human mind"
"This takes place in the democratic state"
"Not Christianity but the human basis of Christianity is the basis of this state"
"Religion remains the ideal non secular consciousness of its members because religion is the ideal form of the stage of human development achieved in this state"
"The members of the political state are religious owing to the dualism between individual life and species life between the life of civil society and political life"
"They are religious because men treat the political life of the state an area beyond their real individuality as if it were their true life"
"They are religious insofar as religion here is the spirit of civil society expressing the separation and remoteness of man from man"
"Political democracy is Christian since in it man not merely one man but everyman ranks as sovereign as the highest being but it is man in his uncivilized unsocial form man in his fortuitous existence man just as he is man as he has been corrupted by the whole organization of our society who has lost himself been alienated and handed over to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements in short man who is not yet a real species being"
"That which is a creation of fantasy a dream a postulate of Christianity i.e. the sovereignty of man but man as an alien being different from the real man becomes in democracy tangible reality present existence and secular principle"
"Christianity attains here the practical expression of its universal religious significance in that the most diverse world outlooks are grouped alongside one another in the form of Christianity and still more because it does not require other people to profess Christianity but only religion in general any kind of religion cf"
"Beaumont ’s work quoted above"
"The religious consciousness revels in the wealth of religious contradictions and religious diversity"
"We have thus shown that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence although not a privileged religion"
"The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself involved in relation to his citizenship is only one aspect of the universal secular contradiction between the political state and civil society"
"The consummation of the Christian state is the state which acknowledges itself as a state and disregards the religion of its members"
"The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion"
"Therefore we do not say to the Jews as Bauer does You can not be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves radically from Judaism"
"On the contrary we tell them Because you can be emancipated politically without renouncing Judaism completely and incontrovertibly political emancipation itself is not human emancipation"
"If you Jews want to be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves humanly the half hearted approach and contradiction is not in you alone it is inherent in the nature and category of political emancipation"
"If you find yourself within the confines of this category you share in a general confinement"
"Just as the state evangelizes when although it is a state it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews so the Jew acts politically when although a Jew he demands civic rights"
"But if a man although a Jew can be emancipated politically and receive civic rights can he lay claim to the so called rights of man and receive them"
"The question is whether the Jew as such that is the Jew who himself admits that he is compelled by his true nature to live permanently in separation from other men is capable of receiving the universal rights of man and of conceding them to others"
"For the Christian world the idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the last century"
"It is not innate in men on the contrary it is gained only in a struggle against the historical traditions in which hitherto man was brought up"
"Thus the rights of man are not a gift of nature not a legacy from past history but the reward of the struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which up to now have been handed down by history from generation to generation"
"These rights are the result of culture and only one who has earned and deserved them can possess them"
"Can the Jew really take possession of them"
"He declares by this separation that the particular nature which makes him a Jew is his true highest nature before which human nature has to give way"
"Similarly the Christian as a Christian can not grant the rights of man"
"According to Bauer man has to sacrifice the privilege of faith to be able to receive the universal rights of man"
"These rights of man are in part political rights rights which can only be exercised in community with others"
"Their content is participation in the community and specifically in the political community in the life of the state"
"They come within the category of political freedom the category of civic rights which as we have seen in no way presuppose the incontrovertible and positive abolition of religion nor therefore of Judaism"
"There remains to be examined the other part of the rights of man the droits d’homme insofar as these differ from the droits d’citoyen"
"Included among them is freedom of conscience the right to practice any religion one chooses"
"The privilege of faith is expressly recognized either as a right of man or as the consequence of a right of man that of liberty"
"Déclaration des droits de l’droits"

"No one is to be subjected to annoyance because of his opinions even religious opinions"
"The freedom of every man to practice the religion of which he is an adherent"
"Constitution of Pennsylvania Article 9 3"
"All men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience and no one can be legally compelled to follow establish or support against his will any religion or religious ministry"
"No human authority can in any circumstances intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul"
"Constitution of New Hampshire Article 5 and 6 Among these natural rights some are by nature inalienable since nothing can replace them"
"The rights of conscience are among them"
"Incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is to such a degree absent from the concept of the rights of man that on the contrary a man ’s right to be religious in any way he chooses to practise his own particular religion is expressly included among the rights of man"
"The privilege of faith is a universal right of man"
"The droits de l’homme the rights of man are as such distinct from the droits du citoyen the rights of the citizen"
"Who is homme as distinct from citoyen"
"None other than the member of civil society"
"Why is the member of civil society called man simply man why are his rights called the rights of man"
"From the relationship between the political state and civil society from the nature of political emancipation"
"Let us hear what the most radical Constitution the Constitution of 1793 has to say Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"
"These rights etc the natural and imprescriptible rights are equality liberty security property"
"Liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of others or according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791 Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others"
"The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post"
"It is a question of the liberty of man as an isolated monad withdrawn into himself"
"Why is the Jew according to Bauer incapable of acquiring the rights of man"
"As long as he is a Jew the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men and will separate him from non Jews"
"But the right of man to liberty is based not on the association of man with man but on the separation of man from man"
"It is the right of this separation the right of the restricted individual withdrawn into himself"
"The practical application of man ’s"
"right to liberty is man ’s"
"right to private property"
"What constitutes man ’s right to private property"
"The right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry"
"The right of man to private property is therefore the right to enjoy one ’s property and to dispose of it at one ’s discretion à son gré without regard to other men independently of society the right of self interest"
"This individual liberty and its application form the basis of civil society"
"It makes every man see in other men not the realization of his own freedom but the barrier to it"
"But above all it proclaims the right of man of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry"
"There remain the other rights of man � galit � and s � ret �"
"Equality used here in its non political sense is nothing but"
"the equality of the libert � described above namely each man is to the same extent regarded as such a self sufficient monad"
"The Constitution of 1795 defines the concept of this equality in accordance with this significance as follows Article 3 Constitution of 1795 Equality consists in the law being the same for all whether it protects or punishes"
"Article 8 Constitution of 1793 Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person his rights and his property"
"Security is the highest social concept of civil society the concept of police expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his person his rights and his property"
"It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society the state of need and reason"
"The concept of security does not raise civil society above its egoism"
"None of the so called rights of man therefore go beyond egoistic man beyond man as a member of civil society"
"that is an individual withdrawn into himself into the confines of his private interests and private caprice and separated from the community"
"In the rights of man he is far from being conceived as a species being on the contrary species life itself society appears as a framework external to the individuals as a restriction of their original independence"
"The sole bond holding them together is natural necessity need and private interest the preservation of their property and their egoistic selves"
"It is puzzling enough that a people which is just beginning to liberate itself to tear down all the barriers between its various sections and to establish a political community that such a people solemnly proclaims Declaration of 1791"
"the rights of egoistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community and that indeed it repeats this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation and is therefore imperatively called for at a moment when the sacrifice of all the interest of civil society must be the order of the day and egoism must be punished as a crime"
"Declaration of the Rights of Man etc of 1793"
"This fact becomes still more puzzling when we see that the political emancipators go so far as to reduce citizenship and the political community to a mere means for maintaining these so called rights of man that therefore the citoyen is declared to be the servant of egotistic homme that the sphere in which man acts as a communal being is degraded to a level below the sphere in which he acts as a partial being and that finally it is not man as citoyen but man as private individual bourgeois who is considered to be the essential and true man"
"The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man"
"Declaration of the Rights etc of 1791 Article 2"
"Government is instituted in order to guarantee man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights"
"Declaration etc of 1793 Article 1"
"Hence even in moments when its enthusiasm still has the freshness of youth and is intensified to an extreme degree by the force of circumstances political life declares itself to be a mere means whose purpose is the life of civil society"
"It is true that its revolutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory"
"Whereas unlimited freedom of the press Constitution of 1793 Article 122 is guaranteed as a consequence of the right of man to individual liberty freedom of the press is totally destroyed because freedom of the press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty"
"Robespierre jeune Historie parlementaire de la R � volution fran � aise by Buchez and Roux vol.28 p. 159"
"That is to say therefore The right of man to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with political life whereas in theory political life is only the guarantee of human rights the rights of the individual and therefore must be abandoned as soon as it comes into contradiction with its aim with these rights of man"
"But practice is merely the exception theory is the rule"
"But even if one were to regard revolutionary practice as the correct presentation of the relationship there would still remain the puzzle of why the relationship is turned upside down in the minds of the political emancipators and the aim appears as the means while the means appears as the aim"
"This optical illusion of their consciousness would still remain a puzzle although now a psychological a theoretical puzzle"
"Political emancipation is at the same time the dissolution of the old society on which the state alienated from the people the sovereign power is based"
"What was the character of the old society"
"The character of the old civil society was directly political that is to say the elements of civil life for example property or the family or the mode of labor were raised to the level of elements of political life in the form of seigniory estates and corporations"
"In this form they determined the relation of the individual to the state as a whole i.e. his political relation that is his relation of separation and exclusion from the other components of society"
"As a result of this organization the unity of the state and also the consciousness will and activity of this unity the general power of the state are likewise bound to appear as the particular affair of a ruler and of his servants isolated from the people"
"The political revolution which overthrew this sovereign power and raised state affairs to become affairs of the people which constituted the political state as a matter of general concern that is as a real state necessarily smashed all estates corporations guilds and privileges since they were all manifestations of the separation of the people from the community"
"The political revolution thereby abolished the political character of civil society"
"It broke up civil society into its simple component parts on the one hand the individuals on the other hand the material and spiritual elements constituting the content of the life and social position of these individuals"
"It set free the political spirit which had been as it were split up partitioned and dispersed in the various blind alleys of feudal society"
"distinct activity and distinct situation in life were reduced to a merely individual significance"
"They no longer constituted the general relation of the individual to the state as a whole"
"Public affairs as such on the other hand became the general affair of each individual and the political function became the individual ’s general function"
"But the completion of the idealism of the state was at the same time the completion of the materialism of civil society"
"Throwing off the political yoke meant at the same time throwing off the bonds which restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society"
"Political emancipation was at the same time the emancipation of civil society from politics from having even the semblance of a universal content"
"Feudal society was resolved into its basic element man but man as he really formed its basis egoistic man"
"This man the member of civil society is thus the basis the precondition of the political state"
"He is recognized as such by this state in the rights of man"
"The liberty of egoistic man and the recognition of this liberty however is rather the recognition of the unrestrained movement of the spiritual and material elements which form the content of his life"
"Hence man was not freed from religion he received religious freedom"
"He was not freed from property he received freedom to own property"
"He was not freed from the egoism of business he received freedom to engage in business"
"The establishment of the political state and the dissolution of civil society into independent individuals whose relation with one another on law just as the relations of men in the system of estates and guilds depended on privilege is accomplished by one and the same act"
"Man as a member of civil society unpolitical man inevitably appears however as the natural man"
"The rights of man appears as natural rights because conscious activity is concentrated on the political act"
"The political revolution resolves civil life into its component parts without revolutionizing these components themselves or subjecting them to criticism"
"It regards civil society the world of needs labor private interests civil law as the basis of its existence as a precondition not requiring further substantiation and therefore as its natural basis"
"Finally man as a member of civil society is held to be man in his sensuous individual immediate existence whereas political man is only abstract artificial man man as an allegorical juridical person"
"The real man is recognized only in the shape of the egoistic individual the true man is recognized only in the shape of the abstract citizen"
"Therefore Rousseau correctly described the abstract idea of political man as follows"
"Whoever dares undertake to establish a people ’s institutions must feel himself capable of changing as it were human nature of transforming each individual who by himself is a complete and solitary whole into a part of a larger whole from which in a sense the individual receives his life and his being of substituting a limited and mental existence for the physical and independent existence"
"He has to take from man his own powers and give him in exchange alien powers which he can not employ without the help of other men"
"Political emancipation is the reduction of man on the one hand to a member of civil society to an egoistic independent individual and on the other hand to a citizen a juridical person"
"Only when the real individual man re absorbs in himself the abstract citizen and as an individual human being has become a species being in his everyday life in his particular work and in his particular situation only when man has recognized and organized his own powers as social powers and consequently no longer separates social power from himself in the shape of political power only then will human emancipation have been accomplished"
"It is in this form that Bauer deals with the relation between the Jewish and the Christian religions and also with their relation to criticism"
"Their relation to criticism is their relation to the capacity to become free"
"The result arrived at is The Christian has to surmount only one stage namely that of his religion in order to give up religion altogether and therefore become free"
"The Jew on the other hand has to break not only with his Jewish nature but also with the development towards perfecting his religion a development which has remained alien to him"
"Thus Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question"
"The theological problem as to whether the Jew or the Christian has the better prospect of salvation is repeated here in the enlightened form which of them is more capable of emancipation"
"No longer is the question asked Is it Judaism or Christianity that makes a man free"
"On the contrary the question is now Which makes man freer the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity"
"If the Jews want to become free they should profess belief not in Christianity but in the dissolution of Christianity in the dissolution of religion in general that is to say in enlightenment criticism and its consequences free humanity"
"For the Jew it is still a matter of a profession of faith but"
"no longer a profession of belief in Christianity but of belief in Christianity in dissolution"
"Bauer demands of the Jews that they should break with the essence of the Christian religion a demand which as he says himself does not arise out of the development of Judaism"
"Since Bauer at the end of his work on the Jewish question had conceived Judaism only as crude religious criticism of Christianity and therefore saw in it merely a religious significance it could be foreseen that the emancipation of the Jews too would be transformed into a philosophical theological act"
"Hence he rightly concludes The Jew contributes nothing to mankind if he himself disregards his narrow law if he invalidates his entire Judaism"
"Accordingly the relation between Jews and Christians becomes the following"
"the sole interest of the Christian in the emancipation of the Jew is a general human interest a theoretical interest"
"As soon as his eye ceases to be religious this fact ceases to be offensive"
"The emancipation of the Jew is in itself not a task for the Christian"
"The Jew on the other hand in order to emancipate himself has to carry out not only his own work but also that of the Christian i.e. the Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics and the Life of Jesus etc"
"It is up to them to deal with it they themselves will decide their fate but history is not to be trifled with"
"We are trying to break with the theological formulation of the question"
"For us the question of the Jew ’s capacity for emancipation becomes the question What particular social element has to be overcome in order to abolish Judaism"
"For the present day Jew ’s capacity for emancipation is the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the modern world"
"This relation necessarily results from the special position of Judaism in the contemporary enslaved world"
"Let us consider the actual worldly Jew not the Sabbath Jew as Bauer does but the everyday Jew"
"What is the secular basis of Judaism"
"Practical need self interest"
"What is the worldly religion of the Jew"
"What is his worldly God"
"An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions for huckstering and therefore the possibility of huckstering would make the Jew impossible"
"His religious consciousness would be dissipated like a thin haze in the real vital air of society"
"On the other hand if the Jew recognizes that this practical nature of his is futile and works to abolish it he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self estrangement"
"We recognize in Judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time an element which through historical development to which in this harmful respect the Jews have zealously contributed has been brought to its present high level at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate"
"In the final analysis the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism"
"The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish way"
"The Jew who in Vienna for example is only tolerated determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power"
"The Jew who may have no rights in the smallest German state decides the fate of Europe"
"While corporations and guilds refuse to admit Jews or have not yet adopted a favorable attitude towards them the audacity of industry mocks at the obstinacy of the material institutions"
"Bruno Bauer The Jewish Question p. 114"
"This is no isolated fact"
"The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner not only because he has acquired financial power but also because through him and also apart from him money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations"
"The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews"
"Captain Hamilton for example reports The devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoön who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him"
"In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbor"
"Trade has seized upon all his thoughts and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects"
"When he travels he carries so to speak his goods and his counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit"
"If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors"
"Indeed in North America the practical domination of Judaism over the Christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the Gospel itself and the Christian ministry have become articles of trade and the bankrupt trader deals in the Gospel just as the Gospel preacher who has become rich goes in for business deals"
"The man who you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader his business having failed he became a minister"
"The other began as a priest but as soon as he had some money at his disposal he left the pulpit to become a trader"
"In the eyes of very many people the religious ministry is a veritable business career"
"According to Bauer it is a fictitious state of affairs when in theory the Jew is deprived of political rights whereas in practice he has immense power and exerts his political influence en gros although it is curtailed en détail"
"Die Judenfrage p. 114"
"The contradiction that exists between the practical political power of the Jew and his political rights is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general"
"Although theoretically the former is superior to the latter in actual fact politics has become the serf of financial power"
"Judaism has held its own alongside Christianity not only as religious criticism of Christianity not only as the embodiment of doubt in the religious derivation of Christianity but equally because the practical Jewish spirit Judaism has maintained itself and even attained its highest development in Christian society"
"The Jew who exists as a distinct member of civil society is only a particular manifestation of the Judaism of civil society"
"Judaism continues to exist not in spite of history but owing to history"
"The Jew is perpetually created by civil society from its own entrails"
"The monotheism of the Jew therefore is in reality the polytheism of the many needs a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine law"
"Practical need egoism is the principle of civil society and as such appears in pure form as soon as civil society has fully given birth to the political state"
"The god of practical need and self interest is money"
"Money is the jealous god of Israel in face of which no other god may exist"
"Money degrades all the gods of man and turns them into commodities"
"Money is the universal self established value of all things"
"It has therefore robbed the whole world both the world of men and nature of its specific value"
"Money is the estranged essence of man ’s work and man ’s existence and this alien essence dominates him and he worships it"
"The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world"
"The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew"
"His god is only an illusory bill of exchange"
"The view of nature attained under the domination of private property and money is a real contempt for and practical debasement of nature in the Jewish religion nature exists it is true but it exists only in imagination"
"It is in this sense that in a 1524 pamphlet Thomas Münzer declares it intolerable that all creatures have been turned into property the fishes in the water the birds in the air the plants on the earth the creatures too must become free"
"The species relation itself the relation between man and woman etc becomes an object of trade"
"The woman is bought and sold"
"The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant of the man of money in general"
"The groundless law of the Jew is only a religious caricature of groundless morality and right in general of the purely formal rites with which the world of self interest surrounds itself"
"Here too man ’s supreme relation is the legal one his relation to laws that are valid for him not because they are laws of his own will and nature but because they are the dominant laws and because departure from them is avenged"
"Jewish Jesuitism the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer discovers in the Talmud is the relation of the world of self interest to the laws governing that world the chief art of which consists in the cunning circumvention of these laws"
"Indeed the movement of this world within its framework of laws is bound to be a continual suspension of law"
"By its very nature the religion of practical need could find its consummation not in theory but only in practice precisely because its truth is practice"
"Judaism could not create a new world it could only draw the new creations and conditions of the world into the sphere of its activity because practical need the rationale of which is self interest is passive and does not expand at will but finds itself enlarged as a result of the continuous development of social conditions"
"Judaism reaches its highest point with the perfection of civil society but it is only in the Christian world that civil society attains perfection"
"Christianity sprang from Judaism"
"It has merged again in Judaism"
"From the outset the Christian was the theorizing Jew the Jew is therefore the practical Christian and the practical Christian has become a Jew again"
"Christianity had only in semblance overcome real Judaism"
"It was too noble minded too spiritualistic to eliminate the crudity of practical need in any other way than by elevation to the skies"
"Christianity is the sublime thought of Judaism Judaism is the common practical application of Christianity but this application could only become general after Christianity as a developed religion had completed theoretically the estrangement of man from himself and from nature"
"Only then could Judaism achieve universal dominance and make alienated man and alienated nature into alienable vendible objects subjected to the slavery of egoistic need and to trading"
"Selling verausserung is the practical aspect of alienation Entausserung"
"In its perfected practice Christian egoism of heavenly bliss is necessarily transformed into the corporal egoism of the Jew heavenly need is turned into world need subjectivism into self interest"
"We explain the tenacity of the Jew not by his religion but on the contrary by the human basis of his religion practical need egoism"
"Since in civil society the real nature of the Jew has been universally realized and secularized civil society could not convince the Jew of the unreality of his religious nature which is indeed only the ideal aspect of practical need"
"Consequently not only in the Pentateuch and the Talmud but in present day society we find the nature of the modern Jew and not as an abstract nature but as one that is in the highest degree empirical not merely as a narrowness of the Jew but as the Jewish narrowness of society"
"Once society has succeeded in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism huckstering and its preconditions the Jew will have become impossible because his consciousness no longer has an object because the subjective basis of Judaism practical need has been humanized and because the conflict between man ’s individual sensuous existence and his species existence has been abolished"

"France he says has recently shown us Proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies December 26 1840"
"The Jewish Question p. 64"
"In France universal freedom is not yet the law the Jewish question too has not yet been solved because legal freedom the fact that all citizens are equal is restricted in actual life which is still dominated and divided by religious privileges and this lack of freedom in actual life reacts on law and compels the latter to sanction the division of the citizens who as such are free into oppressed and oppressors"
"When therefore would the Jewish question be solved for France"
"The Jew for example would have ceased to be a Jew if he did not allow himself to be prevented by his laws from fulfilling his duty to the state and his fellow citizens that is for example if on the Sabbath he attended the Chamber of Deputies and took part in the official proceedings"
"Every religious privilege and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church would have been abolished altogether and if some or many persons or even the overwhelming majority still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter"
"There is no longer any religion when there is no longer any privileged religion"
"Take from religion its exclusive power and it will no longer exist"
"Bauer therefore demands on the one hand that the Jew should renounce Judaism and that mankind in general should renounce religion in order to achieve civic emancipation"
"On the other hand he quite consistently regards the political abolition of religion as the abolition of religion as such"
"Of course the religious notion affords security to the state"
"But to what state"
"To what kind of state"
"At this point the one sided formulation of the Jewish question becomes evident"
"It was by no means sufficient to investigate"
"Who is to emancipate"
"Who is to be emancipated"
"Criticism had to investigate a third point"
"It had to inquire What kind of emancipation is in question"
"What conditions follow from the very nature of the emancipation that is demanded"
"Only the criticism of political emancipation itself would have been the conclusive criticism of the Jewish question and its real merging in the general question of time"
"He puts forward conditions which are not based on the nature of political emancipation itself"
"He raises questions which are not part of his problem and he solves problems which leave this question unanswered"
"cit p. 3 we find that his error lies in the fact that he subjects to criticism only the Christian state not the state as such that he does not investigate the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation and therefore puts forward conditions which can be explained only by uncritical confusion of political emancipation with general human emancipation"
"If Bauer asks the Jews Have you from your standpoint the right to want political emancipation"
"We ask the converse question"
"Does the standpoint of political emancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion"
"The Jewish question acquires a different form depending on the state in which the Jew lives"
"In Germany where there is no political state no state as such the Jewish question is a purely theological one"
"The Jew finds himself in religious opposition to the state which recognizes Christianity as its basis"
"This state is a theologian ex professo"
"Criticism here is criticism of theology a double edged criticism criticism of Christian theology and of Jewish theology"
"In France a constitutional state the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism the question of the incompleteness of political emancipation"
"Only in the North American states at least in some of them does the Jewish question lose its theological significance and become a really secular question"
"Only where the political state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew and of the religious man in general to the political state and therefore the relation of religion to the state show itself in its specific character in its purity"
"The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism as soon as the state ceases to adopt a theological attitude toward religion as soon as it behaves towards religion as a state i.e. politically"
"Criticism then becomes criticism of the political state"
"At this point where the question ceases to be theological Bauer ’s criticism ceases to be critical"
"In the United States there is neither a state religion nor a religion declared to be that of the majority nor the predominance of one cult over another"
"The state stands aloof from all cults"
"Marie ou l’esclavage aux Etats Unis etc by G. de Beaumont Paris 1835 p. 214"
"Indeed there are some North American states where the constitution does not impose any religious belief or religious practice as a condition of political rights"
"Nevertheless in the United States people do not believe that a man without religion could be an honest man"
"Nevertheless North America is pre eminently the country of religiosity as Beaumont Tocqueville and the Englishman Hamilton unanimously assure us"
"The North American states however serve us only as an example"
"The question is What is the relation of complete political emancipation to religion"
"If we find that even in the country of complete political emancipation religion not only exists but displays a fresh and vigorous vitality that is proof that the existence of religion is not in contradiction to the perfection of the state"
"Since however the existence of religion is the existence of defect the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself"
"We no longer regard religion as the cause but only as the manifestation of secular narrowness"
"We do not assert that they must overcome their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular restrictions we assert that they will overcome their religious narrowness once they get rid of their secular restrictions"
"We do not turn secular questions into theological ones"
"The question of the relation of political emancipation to religion becomes for us the question of the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation"
"We criticize the religious weakness of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular form apart from its weaknesses as regards religion"
"The contradiction between the state and a particular religion for instance Judaism is given by us a human form as the contradiction between the state and particular secular elements the contradiction between the state and religion in general as the contradiction between the state and its presuppositions in general"
"The political emancipation of the Jew the Christian and in general of religious man is the emancipation of the state from Judaism from Christianity from religion in general"
"In its own form in the manner characteristic of its nature the state as a state emancipates itself from religion by emancipating itself from the state religion that is to say by the state as a state not professing any religion but on the contrary asserting itself as a state"
"The political emancipation from religion is not a religious emancipation that has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction because political emancipation is not a form of human emancipation which has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction"
"The limits of political emancipation are evident at once from the fact that the state can free itself from a restriction without man being really free from this restriction that the state can be a free state pun on word Freistaat which also means republic without man being a free man"
"Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he lays down the following condition for political emancipation"
"Every religious privilege and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church would have been abolished altogether and if some or many persons or even the overwhelming majority still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter"
"The Jewish Question p. 65"
"It is possible therefore for the state to have emancipated itself from religion even if the overwhelming majority is still religious"
"And the overwhelming majority does not cease to be religious through being religious in private"
"But the attitude of the state and of the republic free state in particular to religion is after all only the attitude to religion of the men who compose the state"
"It follows from this that man frees himself through the medium of the state that he frees himself politically from a limitation when in contradiction with himself he raises himself above this limitation in an abstract limited and partial way"
"It follows further that by freeing himself politically man frees himself in a roundabout way through an intermediary although an essential intermediary"
"It follows finally that man even if he proclaims himself an atheist through the medium of the state that is if he proclaims the state to be atheist still remains in the grip of religion precisely because he acknowledges himself only by a roundabout route only through an intermediary"
"The political elevation of man above religion shares all the defects and all the advantages of political elevation in general"
"The state as a state annuls for instance private property man declares by political means that private property is abolished as soon as the property qualification for the right to elect or be elected is abolished as has occurred in many states of North America"
"Hamilton quite correctly interprets this fact from a political point of view as meaning"
"the masses have won a victory over the property owners and financial wealth"
"Thomas Hamilton Men and Manners in America 2 vols Edinburgh 1833 p. 146"
"Is not private property abolished in idea if the non property owner has become the legislator for the property owner"
"The property qualification for the suffrage is the last political form of giving recognition to private property"
"Nevertheless the political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it"
"Nevertheless the state allows private property education occupation to act in their way i.e. as private property as education as occupation and to exert the influence of their special nature"
"Far from abolishing these real distinctions the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being"
"In order that the state should come into existence as the self knowing moral reality of the mind its distraction from the form of authority and faith is essential"
"But this distinction emerges only insofar as the ecclesiastical aspect arrives at a separation within itself"
"It is only in this way that the state above the particular churches has achieved and brought into existence universality of thought which is the principle of its form Hegel ’s Philosophy of Right 1st edition p. 346"
"Only in this way above the particular elements does the state constitute itself as universality"
"The perfect political state is by its nature man ’s species life as opposed to his material life"
"All the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the sphere of the state but as qualities of civil society"
"Where the political state has attained its true development man not only in thought in consciousness but in reality in life leads a twofold life a heavenly and an earthly life life in the political community in which he considers himself a communal being and life in civil society in which he acts as a private individual regards other men as a means degrades himself into a means and becomes the plaything of alien powers"
"The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society and it prevails over the latter in the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world i.e. by likewise having always to acknowledge it to restore it and allow itself to be dominated by it"
"In his most immediate reality in civil society man is a secular being"
"Here where he regards himself as a real individual and is so regarded by others he is a fictitious phenomenon"
"In the state on the other hand where man is regarded as a species being he is the imaginary member of an illusory sovereignty is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality"
"Man as the adherent of a particular religion finds himself in conflict with his citizenship and with other men as members of the community"
"For man as a bourgeois i.e. as a member of civil society bourgeois society in German life in the state is only a semblance or a temporary exception to the essential and the rule"
"Of course the bourgeois like the Jew remains only sophistically in the sphere of political life just as the citoyen citizen in French i.e. the participant in political life only sophistically remains a Jew or a bourgeois"
"It is the sophistry of the political state itself"
"The difference between the merchant and the citizen Staatsbürger between the day laborer and the citizen between the landowner and the citizen between the merchant and the citizen between the living individual and the citizen"
"The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man is the same contradiction in which the bourgeois finds himself with the citoyen and the member of civil society with his political lion ’s skin"
"This secular conflict to which the Jewish question ultimately reduces itself the relation between the political state and its preconditions whether these are material elements such as private property etc or spiritual elements such as culture or religion the conflict between the general interest and private interest the schism between the political state and civil society these secular antitheses Bauer allows to persist whereas he conducts a polemic against their religious expression"
"It is precisely the basis of civil society the need that ensures the continuance of this society and guarantees its necessity which exposes its existence to continual dangers maintains in it an element of uncertainty and produces that continually changing mixture of poverty and riches of distress and prosperity and brings about change in general"
"Compare the whole section Civil Society pp 8 9 which has been drawn up along the basic lines of Hegel ’s philosophy of law"
"Civil society in its opposition to the political state is recognized as necessary because the political state is recognized as necessary"
"Political emancipation is of course a big step forward"
"It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real practical emancipation"
"Man emancipates himself politically from religion by banishing it from the sphere of public law to that of private law"
"Religion is no longer the spirit of the state in which man behaves although in a limited way in a particular form and in a particular sphere as a species being in community with other men"
"Religion has become the spirit of civil society of the sphere of egoism of bellum omnium contra omnes"
"It is no longer the essence of community but the essence of difference"
"It has become the expression of man ’s separation from his community from himself and from other men as it was originally"
"It is only the abstract avowal of specific perversity private whimsy and arbitrariness"
"The endless fragmentation of religion in North America for example gives it even externally the form of a purely individual affair"
"It has been thrust among the multitude of private interests and ejected from the community as such"
"But one should be under no illusion about the limits of political emancipation"
"The division of the human being into a public man and a private man the displacement of religion from the state into civil society this is not a stage of political emancipation but its completion this emancipation therefore neither abolished the real religiousness of man nor strives to do so"
"The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen Protestant and citizen religious man and citizen is neither a deception directed against citizenhood nor is it a circumvention of political emancipation it is political emancipation itself the political method of emancipating oneself from religion"
"Of course in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society when political liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation the state can and must go as far as the abolition of religion the destruction of religion"
"But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property to the maximum to confiscation to progressive taxation just as it goes as far as the abolition of life the guillotine"
"At times of special self confidence political life seeks to suppress its prerequisite civil society and the elements composing this society and to constitute itself as the real species life of man devoid of contradictions"
"Indeed the perfect Christian state is not the so called Christian state which acknowledges Christianity as its basis as the state religion and therefore adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions"
"On the contrary the perfect Christian state is the atheistic state the democratic state the state which relegates religion to a place among the other elements of civil society"
"The state which is still theological which still officially professes Christianity as its creed which still does not dare to proclaim itself as a state has in its reality as a state not yet succeeded in expressing the human basis of which Christianity is the high flown expression in a secular human form"
"The so called Christian state is simply nothing more than a non state since it is not Christianity as a religion but only the human background of the Christian religion which can find its expression in actual human creations"
"The so called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state but by no means the political realization of Christianity"
"The state which still professes Christianity in the form of religion does not yet profess it in the form appropriate to the state for it still has a religious attitude towards religion"
"that is to say it is not the true implementation of the human basis of religion because it still relies on the unreal imaginary form of this human core"
"The so called Christian state is the imperfect state and the Christian religion is regarded by it as the supplementation and sanctification of its imperfection"
"For the Christian state therefore religion necessarily becomes a means hence it is a hypocritical state"
"It makes a great difference whether the complete state because of the defect inherent in the general nature of the state counts religion among its presuppositions or whether the incomplete state because of the defect inherent in its particular existence as a defective state declares that religion is its basis"
"In the latter case religion becomes imperfect politics"
"In the former case the imperfection even of consummate politics becomes evident in religion"
"The so called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself as a state"
"The democratic state the real state does not need religion for its political completion"
"The so called Christian state on the other hand has a political attitude to religion and a religious attitude to politics"
"By degrading the forms of the state to mere semblance it equally degrades religion to mere semblance"
"In order to make this contradiction clearer let us consider Bauer ’s projection of the Christian state a projection based on his observation of the Christian German state"
"Recently says Bauer in order to prove the impossibility or non existence of a Christian state reference has frequently been made to those sayings in the Gospel with which the present day state not only does not comply but can not possibly comply if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state"
"But the matter can not be disposed of so easily"
"What do these Gospel sayings demand"
"Supernatural renunciation of self submission to the authority of revelation a turning away from the state the abolition of secular conditions"
"Well the Christian state demands and accomplishes all that"
"It has assimilated the spirit of the Gospel and if it does not reproduce this spirit in the same terms as the Gospel that occurs only because it expresses this spirit in political forms i.e. in forms which it is true are taken from the political system in this world but which in the religious rebirth that they have to undergo become degraded to a mere semblance"
"Bauer then explains that the people of a Christian state is only a non people no longer having a will of its own but whose true existence lies in the leader to whom it is subjected although this leader by his origin and nature is alien to it i.e. given by God and imposed on the people without any co operation on its part"
"Bauer declares that the laws of such a people are not its own creation but are actual revelations that its supreme chief needs privileged intermediaries with the people in the strict sense with the masses and that the masses themselves are divided into a multitude of particular groupings which are formed and determined by chance which are differentiated by their interests their particular passions and prejudices and obtain permission as a privilege to isolate themselves from one another etc"
"Politics if it is to be nothing but religion ought not to be politics just as the cleaning of saucepans if it is to be accepted as a religious matter ought not to be regarded as a matter of domestic economy"
"In the Christian German state however religion is an economic matter just as economic matters belong to the sphere of religion"
"The domination of religion in the Christian German state is the religion of domination"
"The separation of the spirit of the Gospel from the letter of the Gospel is an irreligious act"
"A state which makes the Gospel speak in the language of politics that is in another language than that of the Holy Ghost commits sacrilege if not in human eyes then in the eyes of its own religion"
"The state which acknowledges Christianity as its supreme criterion and the Bible as its Charter must be confronted with the words of Holy Scripture for every word of Scripture is holy"
"This state as well as the human rubbish on which it is based is caught in a painful contradiction that is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness when it is referred to those sayings of the Gospel with which it not only does not comply but can not possibly comply if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state"
"And why does it not want to dissolve itself completely"
"The state itself can not give an answer either to itself or to others"
"In its own consciousness the official Christian state is an imperative the realization of which is unattainable the state can assert the reality of its existence only by lying to itself and therefore always remains in its own eyes an object of doubt an unreliable problematic object"
"Criticism is therefore fully justified in forcing the state that relies on the Bible into a mental derangement in which it no longer knows whether it is an illusion or a reality and in which the infamy of its secular aims for which religion serves as a cloak comes into insoluble conflict with the sincerity of its religious consciousness for which religion appears as the aim of the world"
"This state can only save itself from its inner torment if it becomes the police agent of the Catholic Church"
"In relation to the church which declares the secular power to be its servant the state is powerless the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit is powerless"
"It is indeed estrangement which matters in the so called Christian state but not man"
"The only man who counts the king is a being specifically different from other men and is moreover a religious being directly linked with heaven with God"
"The relationships which prevail here are still relationships dependent of faith"
"The religious spirit therefore is still not really secularized"
"But furthermore the religious spirit can not be really secularized for what is it in itself"
"but the non secular form of a stage in the development of the human mind"
"This takes place in the democratic state"
"Religion remains the ideal non secular consciousness of its members because religion is the ideal form of the stage of human development achieved in this state"
"The members of the political state are religious owing to the dualism between individual life and species life between the life of civil society and political life"
"They are religious because men treat the political life of the state an area beyond their real individuality as if it were their true life"
"They are religious insofar as religion here is the spirit of civil society expressing the separation and remoteness of man from man"
"Political democracy is Christian since in it man not merely one man but everyman ranks as sovereign as the highest being but it is man in his uncivilized unsocial form man in his fortuitous existence man just as he is man as he has been corrupted by the whole organization of our society who has lost himself been alienated and handed over to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements in short man who is not yet a real species being"
"That which is a creation of fantasy a dream a postulate of Christianity i.e. the sovereignty of man but man as an alien being different from the real man becomes in democracy tangible reality present existence and secular principle"
"In the perfect democracy the religious and theological consciousness itself is in its own eyes the more religious and the more theological because it is apparently without political significance without worldly aims the concern of a disposition that shuns the world the expression of intellectual narrow mindedness the product of arbitrariness and fantasy and because it is a life that is really of the other world"
"Christianity attains here the practical expression of its universal religious significance in that the most diverse world outlooks are grouped alongside one another in the form of Christianity and still more because it does not require other people to profess Christianity but only religion in general any kind of religion cf"
"Beaumont ’s work quoted above"
"The religious consciousness revels in the wealth of religious contradictions and religious diversity"
"We have thus shown that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence although not a privileged religion"
"The consummation of the Christian state is the state which acknowledges itself as a state and disregards the religion of its members"
"The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion"
"Therefore we do not say to the Jews as Bauer does You can not be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves radically from Judaism"
"If you Jews want to be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves humanly the half hearted approach and contradiction is not in you alone it is inherent in the nature and category of political emancipation"
"If you find yourself within the confines of this category you share in a general confinement"
"Just as the state evangelizes when although it is a state it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews so the Jew acts politically when although a Jew he demands civic rights"
"But if a man although a Jew can be emancipated politically and receive civic rights can he lay claim to the so called rights of man and receive them"
"The question is whether the Jew as such that is the Jew who himself admits that he is compelled by his true nature to live permanently in separation from other men is capable of receiving the universal rights of man and of conceding them to others"
"For the Christian world the idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the last century"
"It is not innate in men on the contrary it is gained only in a struggle against the historical traditions in which hitherto man was brought up"
"These rights are the result of culture and only one who has earned and deserved them can possess them"
"Can the Jew really take possession of them"
"As long as he is a Jew the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men and will separate him from non Jews"
"He declares by this separation that the particular nature which makes him a Jew is his true highest nature before which human nature has to give way"
"Similarly the Christian as a Christian can not grant the rights of man"
"According to Bauer man has to sacrifice the privilege of faith to be able to receive the universal rights of man"
"Let us examine for a moment the so called rights of man to be precise the rights of man in their authentic form in the form which they have among those who discovered them the North Americans and the French"
"These rights of man are in part political rights rights which can only be exercised in community with others"
"Their content is participation in the community and specifically in the political community in the life of the state"
"They come within the category of political freedom the category of civic rights which as we have seen in no way presuppose the incontrovertible and positive abolition of religion nor therefore of Judaism"
"There remains to be examined the other part of the rights of man the droits d’homme insofar as these differ from the droits d’citoyen"
"Included among them is freedom of conscience the right to practice any religion one chooses"
"The privilege of faith is expressly recognized either as a right of man or as the consequence of a right of man that of liberty"
"Déclaration des droits de l’droits"
"et du citoyen 1791 Article 10"
"No one is to be subjected to annoyance because of his opinions even religious opinions"
"The freedom of every man to practice the religion of which he is an adherent"
"Declaration of the Rights of Man etc 1793 includes among the rights of man Article 7 The free exercise of religion"
"Indeed in regard to man ’s right to express his thoughts and opinions to hold meetings and to exercise his religion it is even stated The necessity of proclaiming these rights presupposes either the existence or the recent memory of despotism"
"Compare the Constitution of 1795 Section XIV Article 354"
"Constitution of Pennsylvania Article 9 3"
"All men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience and no one can be legally compelled to follow establish or support against his will any religion or religious ministry"
"No human authority can in any circumstances intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul"
"The rights of conscience are among them"
"Incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is to such a degree absent from the concept of the rights of man that on the contrary a man ’s right to be religious in any way he chooses to practise his own particular religion is expressly included among the rights of man"
"The privilege of faith is a universal right of man"
"The droits de l’homme the rights of man are as such distinct from the droits du citoyen the rights of the citizen"
"Who is homme as distinct from citoyen"
"None other than the member of civil society"
"Why is the member of civil society called man simply man why are his rights called the rights of man"
"How is this fact to be explained"
"From the relationship between the political state and civil society from the nature of political emancipation"
"Above all we note the fact that the so called rights of man the droits de l’homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society i.e. the rights of egoistic man of man separated from other men and from the community"
"Let us hear what the most radical Constitution the Constitution of 1793 has to say"
"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"
"These rights etc the natural and imprescriptible rights are equality liberty security property"
"Liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of others or according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791 Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others"
"Liberty therefore is the right to do everything that harms no one else"
"The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post"
"As long as he is a Jew the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men and will separate him from non Jews"
"But the right of man to liberty is based not on the association of man with man but on the separation of man from man"
"It is the right of this separation the right of the restricted individual withdrawn into himself"
"The practical application of man ’s"
"right to liberty is man ’s"
"What constitutes man ’s right to private property"
"The right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry"
"The right of man to private property is therefore the right to enjoy one ’s property and to dispose of it at one ’s discretion à son gré without regard to other men independently of society the right of self interest"
"This individual liberty and its application form the basis of civil society"
"It makes every man see in other men not the realization of his own freedom but the barrier to it"
"But above all it proclaims the right of man"
"of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry"
"There remain the other rights of man � galit � and s � ret �"
"Equality used here in its non political sense is nothing but"
"the equality of the libert � described above namely each man is to the same extent regarded as such a self sufficient monad"
"The Constitution of 1795 defines the concept of this equality in accordance with this significance as follows"
"Article 8 Constitution of 1793"
"Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person his rights and his property"
"Security is the highest social concept of civil society the concept of police expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his person his rights and his property"
"It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society the state of need and reason"
"The concept of security does not raise civil society above its egoism"
"On the contrary security is the insurance of egoism"
"that is an individual withdrawn into himself into the confines of his private interests and private caprice and separated from the community"
"In the rights of man he is far from being conceived as a species being on the contrary species life itself society appears as a framework external to the individuals as a restriction of their original independence"
"The sole bond holding them together is natural necessity need and private interest the preservation of their property and their egoistic selves"
"It is puzzling enough that a people which is just beginning to liberate itself to tear down all the barriers between its various sections and to establish a political community that such a people solemnly proclaims Declaration of 1791"
"the rights of egoistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community and that indeed it repeats this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation and is therefore imperatively called for at a moment when the sacrifice of all the interest of civil society must be the order of the day and egoism must be punished as a crime"
"Declaration of the Rights of Man etc of 1793"
"This fact becomes still more puzzling when we see that the political emancipators go so far as to reduce citizenship and the political community to a mere means for maintaining these so called rights of man that therefore the citoyen is declared to be the servant of egotistic homme that the sphere in which man acts as a communal being is degraded to a level below the sphere in which he acts as a partial being and that finally it is not man as citoyen but man as private individual bourgeois who is considered to be the essential and true man"
"The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man"
"Government is instituted in order to guarantee man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights"
"Declaration etc of 1793 Article 1"
"Hence even in moments when its enthusiasm still has the freshness of youth and is intensified to an extreme degree by the force of circumstances political life declares itself to be a mere means whose purpose is the life of civil society"
"Whereas for example security is declared one of the rights of man violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly declared to be the order of the day"
"Whereas unlimited freedom of the press Constitution of 1793 Article 122 is guaranteed as a consequence of the right of man to individual liberty freedom of the press is totally destroyed because freedom of the press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty"
"Robespierre jeune Historie parlementaire de la R � volution fran � aise by Buchez and Roux vol.28 p. 159"
"That is to say therefore The right of man to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with political life whereas in theory political life is only the guarantee of human rights the rights of the individual and therefore must be abandoned as soon as it comes into contradiction with its aim with these rights of man"
"But practice is merely the exception theory is the rule"
"This optical illusion of their consciousness would still remain a puzzle although now a psychological a theoretical puzzle"
"Political emancipation is at the same time the dissolution of the old society on which the state alienated from the people the sovereign power is based"
"It can be described in one word feudalism"
"The character of the old civil society was directly political that is to say the elements of civil life for example property or the family or the mode of labor were raised to the level of elements of political life in the form of seigniory estates and corporations"
"In this form they determined the relation of the individual to the state as a whole i.e. his political relation that is his relation of separation and exclusion from the other components of society"
"For that organization of national life did not raise property or labor to the level of social elements on the contrary it completed their separation from the state as a whole and constituted them as discrete societies within society"
"Thus the vital functions and conditions of life of civil society remained nevertheless political although political in the feudal sense that is to say they secluded the individual from the state as a whole and they converted the particular relation of his corporation to the state as a whole into his general relation to the life of the nation just as they converted his particular civil activity and situation into his general activity and situation"
"As a result of this organization the unity of the state and also the consciousness will and activity of this unity the general power of the state are likewise bound to appear as the particular affair of a ruler and of his servants isolated from the people"
"The political revolution which overthrew this sovereign power and raised state affairs to become affairs of the people which constituted the political state as a matter of general concern that is as a real state necessarily smashed all estates corporations guilds and privileges since they were all manifestations of the separation of the people from the community"
"The political revolution thereby abolished the political character of civil society"
"It broke up civil society into its simple component parts on the one hand the individuals on the other hand the material and spiritual elements constituting the content of the life and social position of these individuals"
"It set free the political spirit which had been as it were split up partitioned and dispersed in the various blind alleys of feudal society"
"distinct activity and distinct situation in life were reduced to a merely individual significance"
"They no longer constituted the general relation of the individual to the state as a whole"
"Public affairs as such on the other hand became the general affair of each individual and the political function became the individual ’s general function"
"But the completion of the idealism of the state was at the same time the completion of the materialism of civil society"
"Throwing off the political yoke meant at the same time throwing off the bonds which restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society"
"Political emancipation was at the same time the emancipation of civil society from politics from having even the semblance of a universal content"
"Feudal society was resolved into its basic element man but man as he really formed its basis egoistic man"
"This man the member of civil society is thus the basis the precondition of the political state"
"He is recognized as such by this state in the rights of man"
"The liberty of egoistic man and the recognition of this liberty however is rather the recognition of the unrestrained movement of the spiritual and material elements which form the content of his life"
"Hence man was not freed from religion he received religious freedom"
"He was not freed from property he received freedom to own property"
"He was not freed from the egoism of business he received freedom to engage in business"
"The establishment of the political state and the dissolution of civil society into independent individuals whose relation with one another on law just as the relations of men in the system of estates and guilds depended on privilege is accomplished by one and the same act"
"Man as a member of civil society unpolitical man inevitably appears however as the natural man"
"The rights of man appears as natural rights because conscious activity is concentrated on the political act"
"Egoistic man is the passive result of the dissolved society a result that is simply found in existence an object of immediate certainty therefore a natural object"
"The political revolution resolves civil life into its component parts without revolutionizing these components themselves or subjecting them to criticism"
"It regards civil society the world of needs labor private interests civil law as the basis of its existence as a precondition not requiring further substantiation and therefore as its natural basis"
"Finally man as a member of civil society is held to be man in his sensuous individual immediate existence whereas political man is only abstract artificial man man as an allegorical juridical person"
"The real man is recognized only in the shape of the egoistic individual the true man is recognized only in the shape of the abstract citizen"
"Therefore Rousseau correctly described the abstract idea of political man as follows"
"Whoever dares undertake to establish a people ’s institutions must feel himself capable of changing as it were human nature of transforming each individual who by himself is a complete and solitary whole into a part of a larger whole from which in a sense the individual receives his life and his being of substituting a limited and mental existence for the physical and independent existence"
"He has to take from man his own powers and give him in exchange alien powers which he can not employ without the help of other men"
"All emancipation is a reduction of the human world and relationships to man himself"
"Political emancipation is the reduction of man on the one hand to a member of civil society to an egoistic independent individual and on the other hand to a citizen a juridical person"
"Only when the real individual man re absorbs in himself the abstract citizen and as an individual human being has become a species being in his everyday life in his particular work and in his particular situation only when man has recognized and organized his own powers as social powers and consequently no longer separates social power from himself in the shape of political power only then will human emancipation have been accomplished"
"The Christian has to surmount only one stage namely that of his religion in order to give up religion altogether"
"The Jew on the other hand has to break not only with his Jewish nature but also with the development towards perfecting his religion a development which has remained alien to him"
"Thus Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question"
"The theological problem as to whether the Jew or the Christian has the better prospect of salvation is repeated here in the enlightened form which of them is more capable of emancipation"
"No longer is the question asked Is it Judaism or Christianity that makes a man free"
"On the contrary the question is now Which makes man freer the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity"
"If the Jews want to become free they should profess belief not in Christianity but in the dissolution of Christianity in the dissolution of religion in general that is to say in enlightenment criticism and its consequences free humanity"
"For the Jew it is still a matter of a profession of faith but"
"no longer a profession of belief in Christianity but of belief in Christianity in dissolution"
"Bauer demands of the Jews that they should break with the essence of the Christian religion a demand which as he says himself does not arise out of the development of Judaism"
"Since Bauer at the end of his work on the Jewish question had conceived Judaism only as crude religious criticism of Christianity and therefore saw in it merely a religious significance it could be foreseen that the emancipation of the Jews too would be transformed into a philosophical theological act"
"Bauer considers that the ideal abstract nature of the Jew his religion is his entire nature"
"Hence he rightly concludes"
"The Jew contributes nothing to mankind if he himself disregards his narrow law if he invalidates his entire Judaism"
"Accordingly the relation between Jews and Christians becomes the following"
"the sole interest of the Christian in the emancipation of the Jew is a general human interest a theoretical interest"
"Judaism is a fact that offends the religious eye of the Christian"
"As soon as his eye ceases to be religious this fact ceases to be offensive"
"The Jew on the other hand in order to emancipate himself has to carry out not only his own work but also that of the Christian i.e. the Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics and the Life of Jesus etc"
"We are trying to break with the theological formulation of the question"
"This relation necessarily results from the special position of Judaism in the contemporary enslaved world"
"Let us consider the actual worldly Jew not the Sabbath Jew as Bauer does but the everyday Jew"
"Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew"
"What is the secular basis of Judaism"
"Practical need self interest"
"What is the worldly religion of the Jew"
"What is his worldly God"
"Emancipation from huckstering and money consequently from practical real Judaism would be the self emancipation of our time"
"An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions for huckstering and therefore the possibility of huckstering would make the Jew impossible"
"His religious consciousness would be dissipated like a thin haze in the real vital air of society"
"On the other hand if the Jew recognizes that this practical nature of his is futile and works to abolish it he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self estrangement"
"In the final analysis the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism"
"The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish way"
"The Jew who in Vienna for example is only tolerated determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power"
"The Jew who may have no rights in the smallest German state decides the fate of Europe"
"While corporations and guilds refuse to admit Jews or have not yet adopted a favorable attitude towards them the audacity of industry mocks at the obstinacy of the material institutions"
"Bruno Bauer The Jewish Question p. 114"
"This is no isolated fact"
"The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner not only because he has acquired financial power but also because through him and also apart from him money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations"
"The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews"
"The devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoön who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him"
"Mammon is his idol which he adores not only with his lips but with the whole force of his body and mind"
"In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbor"
"Trade has seized upon all his thoughts and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects"
"When he travels he carries so to speak his goods and his counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit"
"If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors"
"Indeed in North America the practical domination of Judaism over the Christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the Gospel itself and the Christian ministry have become articles of trade and the bankrupt trader deals in the Gospel just as the Gospel preacher who has become rich goes in for business deals"
"The man who you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader his business having failed he became a minister"
"The other began as a priest but as soon as he had some money at his disposal he left the pulpit to become a trader"
"In the eyes of very many people the religious ministry is a veritable business career"
"a fictitious state of affairs when in theory the Jew is deprived of political rights whereas in practice he has immense power and exerts his political influence en gros although it is curtailed en détail"
"Die Judenfrage p. 114"
"The contradiction that exists between the practical political power of the Jew and his political rights is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general"
"Although theoretically the former is superior to the latter in actual fact politics has become the serf of financial power"
"Judaism has held its own alongside Christianity not only as religious criticism of Christianity not only as the embodiment of doubt in the religious derivation of Christianity but equally because the practical Jewish spirit Judaism has maintained itself and even attained its highest development in Christian society"
"The Jew who exists as a distinct member of civil society is only a particular manifestation of the Judaism of civil society"
"Judaism continues to exist not in spite of history but owing to history"
"The Jew is perpetually created by civil society from its own entrails"
"The monotheism of the Jew therefore is in reality the polytheism of the many needs a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine law"
"Practical need egoism is the principle of civil society and as such appears in pure form as soon as civil society has fully given birth to the political state"
"The god of practical need and self interest is money"
"Money degrades all the gods of man and turns them into commodities"
"Money is the universal self established value of all things"
"It has therefore robbed the whole world both the world of men and nature of its specific value"
"Money is the estranged essence of man ’s work and man ’s existence and this alien essence dominates him and he worships it"
"The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world"
"The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew"
"His god is only an illusory bill of exchange"
"The view of nature attained under the domination of private property and money is a real contempt for and practical debasement of nature in the Jewish religion nature exists it is true but it exists only in imagination"
"It is in this sense that in a 1524 pamphlet Thomas Münzer declares it intolerable"
"that all creatures have been turned into property the fishes in the water the birds in the air the plants on the earth the creatures too must become free"
"Contempt for theory art history and for man as an end in himself which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish religion is the real conscious standpoint the virtue of the man of money"
"The species relation itself the relation between man and woman etc becomes an object of trade"
"The woman is bought and sold"
"The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant of the man of money in general"
"The groundless law of the Jew is only a religious caricature of groundless morality and right in general of the purely formal rites with which the world of self interest surrounds itself"
"Here too man ’s supreme relation is the legal one his relation to laws that are valid for him not because they are laws of his own will and nature but because they are the dominant laws and because departure from them is avenged"
"Jewish Jesuitism the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer discovers in the Talmud is the relation of the world of self interest to the laws governing that world the chief art of which consists in the cunning circumvention of these laws"
"Indeed the movement of this world within its framework of laws is bound to be a continual suspension of law"
"Judaism could not develop further as a religion could not develop further theoretically because the world outlook of practical need is essentially limited and is completed in a few strokes"
"By its very nature the religion of practical need could find its consummation not in theory but only in practice precisely because its truth is practice"
"Judaism could not create a new world it could only draw the new creations and conditions of the world into the sphere of its activity because practical need the rationale of which is self interest is passive and does not expand at will but finds itself enlarged as a result of the continuous development of social conditions"
"Only under the dominance of Christianity which makes all national natural moral and theoretical conditions extrinsic to man could civil society separate itself completely from the life of the state sever all the species ties of man put egoism and selfish need in the place of these species ties and dissolve the human world into a world of atomistic individuals who are inimically opposed to one another"
"Christianity sprang from Judaism"
"It has merged again in Judaism"
"From the outset the Christian was the theorizing Jew the Jew is therefore the practical Christian and the practical Christian has become a Jew again"
"Christianity had only in semblance overcome real Judaism"
"It was too noble minded too spiritualistic to eliminate the crudity of practical need in any other way than by elevation to the skies"
"Christianity is the sublime thought of Judaism Judaism is the common practical application of Christianity but this application could only become general after Christianity as a developed religion had completed theoretically the estrangement of man from himself and from nature"
"Selling verausserung is the practical aspect of alienation Entausserung"
"Just as man as long as he is in the grip of religion is able to objectify his essential nature only by turning it into something alien something fantastic so under the domination of egoistic need he can be active practically and produce objects in practice only by putting his products and his activity under the domination of an alien being and bestowing the significance of an alien entity money on them"
"In its perfected practice Christian egoism of heavenly bliss is necessarily transformed into the corporal egoism of the Jew heavenly need is turned into world need subjectivism into self interest"
"Since in civil society the real nature of the Jew has been universally realized and secularized civil society could not convince the Jew of the unreality of his religious nature which is indeed only the ideal aspect of practical need"
"Consequently not only in the Pentateuch and the Talmud but in present day society we find the nature of the modern Jew and not as an abstract nature but as one that is in the highest degree empirical not merely as a narrowness of the Jew but as the Jewish narrowness of society"
"Once society has succeeded in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism huckstering and its preconditions the Jew will have become impossible because his consciousness no longer has an object because the subjective basis of Judaism practical need has been humanized and because the conflict between man ’s individual sensuous existence and his species existence has been abolished"
"The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism"

"For Germany the criticism of religion has been essentially completed and the criticism of religion is the prerequisite of all criticism"
"The profane existence of error is compromised as soon as its heavenly oratio pro aris et focis speech for the altars and hearths i.e. for God and country has been refuted"
"Man who has found only the reflection of himself in the fantastic reality of heaven where he sought a superman will no longer feel disposed to find the mere appearance of himself the non man Unmensch where he seeks and must seek his true reality"
"The foundation of irreligious criticism is Man makes religion religion does not make man"
"Religion is indeed the self consciousness and self esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself or has already lost himself again"
"But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world"
"Man is the world of man state society"
"This state and this society produce religion which is an inverted consciousness of the world because they are an inverted world"
"Religion is the general theory of this world its encyclopaedic compendium its logic in popular form its spiritual point d’honneur its enthusiasm its moral sanction its solemn complement and its universal basis of consolation and justification"
"It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality"
"The struggle against religion is therefore indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion"
"Religious suffering is at one and the same time the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering"
"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions"
"It is the opium of the people"
"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness"
"To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions"
"The criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo"
"Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower"
"Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself"
"It is therefore the task of history once the other world of truth has vanished to establish the truth of this world"
"It is the immediate task of philosophy which is in the service of history to unmask self estrangement in its unholy forms once the holy form of human self estrangement has been unmasked"
"The following exposition a full scale critical study of Hegel ’s Philosophy of Right was supposed to follow this introduction a contribution to this undertaking concerns itself not directly with the original but with a copy with the German philosophy of the state and of law"
"The only reason for this is that it is concerned with Germany"
"If we were to begin with the German status quo itself the result even if we were to do it in the only appropriate way i.e. negatively would still be an anachronism"
"Even the negation of our present political situation is a dusty fact in the historical junk room of modern nations"
"If I negate powdered pigtails I am still left with unpowdered pigtails"
"If I negate the situation in Germany in 1843 then according to the French calendar I have barely reached 1789 much less the vital centre of our present age"
"Indeed German history prides itself on having travelled a road which no other nation in the whole of history has ever travelled before or ever will again"
"We have been restored firstly because other nations dared to make revolutions and secondly because other nations suffered counter revolutions on the one hand because our masters were afraid and on the other because they were not afraid"
"With our shepherds to the fore we only once kept company with freedom on the day of its internment"
"One school of thought that legitimizes the infamy of today with the infamy of yesterday a school that stigmatizes every cry of the serf against the knout as mere rebelliousness once the knout has aged a little and acquired a hereditary significance and a history a school to which history shows nothing but its a posteriori as did the God of Israel to his servant Moses the historical school of law this school would have invented German history were it not itself an invention of that history"
"A Shylock but a cringing Shylock that swears by its bond its historical bond its Christian Germanic bond for every pound of flesh cut from the heart of the people"
"Good natured enthusiasts Germanomaniacs by extraction and free thinkers by reflexion on the contrary seek our history of freedom beyond our history in the ancient Teutonic forests"
"But what difference is there between the history of our freedom and the history of the boar ’s freedom if it can be found only in the forests"
"So peace to the ancient Teutonic forests"
"War on the German state of affairs"
"They are below the level of history they are beneath any criticism but they are still an object of criticism like the criminal who is below the level of humanity but still an object for the executioner"
"In the struggle against that state of affairs criticism is no passion of the head it is the head of passion"
"It is not a lancet it is a weapon"
"Its object is its enemy which it wants not to refute but to exterminate"
"For the spirit of that state of affairs is refuted"
"In itself it is no object worthy of thought it is an existence which is as despicable as it is despised"
"Criticism does not need to make things clear to itself as regards this object for it has already settled accounts with it"
"It no longer assumes the quality of an end in itself but only of a means"
"Its essential pathos is indignation its essential work is denunciation"
"It is a case of describing the dull reciprocal pressure of all social spheres one on another a general inactive ill humor a limitedness which recognizes itself as much as it mistakes itself within the frame of government system which living on the preservation of all wretchedness is itself nothing but wretchedness in office"
"This infinitely proceeding division of society into the most manifold races opposed to one another by petty antipathies uneasy consciences and brutal mediocrity and which precisely because of their reciprocal ambiguous and distrustful attitude are all without exception although with various formalities treated by their rulers as conceded existences"
"And they must recognize and acknowledge as a concession of heaven the very fact that they are mastered ruled possessed"
"And on the other side are the rulers themselves whose greatness is in inverse proportion to their number"
"Criticism dealing with this content is criticism in a hand to hand fight and in such a fight the point is not whether the opponent is a noble equal interesting opponent the point is to strike him"
"The point is not to let the Germans have a minute for self deception and resignation"
"The actual pressure must be made more pressing by adding to it consciousness of pressure the shame must be made more shameful by publicizing it"
"The people must be taught to be terrified at itself in order to give it courage"
"This will be fulfilling an imperative need of the German nation and the needs of the nations are in themselves the ultimate reason for their satisfaction"
"This struggle against the limited content of the German status quo can not be without interest even for the modern nations for the German status quo is the open completion of the ancien régime and the ancien régime is the concealed deficiency of the modern state"
"The struggle against the German political present is the struggle against the past of the modern nations and they are still burdened with reminders of that past"
"Tragic indeed was the pre existing power of the world and freedom on the other hand was a personal notion in short as long as it believed and had to believe in its own justification"
"As long as the ancien régime as an existing world order struggled against a world that was only coming into being there was on its side a historical error not a personal one"
"That is why its downfall was tragic"
"On the other hand the present German regime an anachronism a flagrant contradiction of generally recognized axioms the nothingness of the ancien régime exhibited to the world only imagines that it believes in itself and demands that the world should imagine the same thing"
"If it believed in its own essence would it try to hide that essence under the semblance of an alien essence and seek refuge in hypocrisy and sophism"
"The modern ancien régime is rather only the comedian of a world order whose true heroes are dead"
"History is thorough and goes through many phases when carrying an old form to the grave"
"The last phases of a world historical form is its comedy"
"The gods of Greece already tragically wounded to death in Aeschylus ’s tragedy Prometheus Bound"
"had to re die a comic death in Lucian ’s Dialogues"
"Why this course of history"
"So that humanity should part with its past cheerfully"
"This cheerful historical destiny is what we vindicate for the political authorities of Germany"
"Meanwhile once modern politico social reality itself is subjected to criticism once criticism rises to truly human problems it finds itself outside the German status quo or else it would reach out for its object below its object"
"The relation of industry of the world of wealth generally to the political world is one of the major problems of modern times"
"In what form is this problem beginning to engage the attention of the Germans"
"In the form of protective duties of the prohibitive system of national economy"
"Germanomania has passed out of man into matter and thus one morning our cotton barons and iron heroes saw themselves turned into patriots"
"People are therefore beginning in Germany to acknowledge the sovereignty of monopoly on the inside through lending it sovereignty on the outside"
"People are therefore now about to begin in Germany what people in France and England are about to end"
"The old corrupt condition against which these countries are revolting in theory and which they only bear as one bears chains is greeted in Germany as the dawn of a beautiful future which still hardly dares to pass from crafty theory to the most ruthless practice"
"Whereas the problem in France and England is Political economy or the rule of society over wealth in Germany it is National economy or the mastery of private property over nationality"
"In France and England then it is a case of abolishing monopoly that has proceeded to its last consequences in Germany it is a case of proceeding to the last consequences of monopoly"
"There it is a case of solution here as yet a case of collision"
"This is an adequate example of the German form of modern problems an example of how our history like a clumsy recruit still has to do extra drill on things that are old and hackneyed in history"
"If therefore the whole German development did not exceed the German political development a German could at the most have the share in the problems of the present that a Russian has"
"The fact that Greece had a Scythian among its philosophers did not help the Scythians to make a single step towards Greek culture"
"An allusion to Anacharsis"
"Luckily we Germans are not Scythians"
"As the ancient peoples went through their pre history in imagination in mythology so we Germans have gone through our post history in thought in philosophy"
"We are philosophical contemporaries of the present without being its historical contemporaries"
"German philosophy is the ideal prolongation of German history"
"If therefore instead of the oeuvres incompletes of our real history we criticize the oeuvres posthumes of our ideal history philosophy our criticism is in the midst of the questions of which the present says that is the question"
"What in progressive nations is a practical break with modern state conditions is in Germany where even those conditions do not yet exist at first a critical break with the philosophical reflexion of those conditions"
"German philosophy of right and state is the only German history which is al pari on a level with the official modern present"
"The German nation must therefore join this its dream history to its present conditions and subject to criticism not only these existing conditions but at the same time their abstract continuation"
"Its future can not be limited either to the immediate negation of its real conditions of state and right or to the immediate implementation of its ideal state and right conditions for it has the immediate negation of its real conditions in its ideal conditions and it has almost outlived the immediate implementation of its ideal conditions in the contemplation of neighboring nations"
"It is wrong not in its demand but in stopping at the demand which it neither seriously implements nor can implement"
"Owing to the limitation of its outlook it does not include philosophy in the circle of German reality or it even fancies it is beneath German practice and the theories that serve it"
"You demand that real life embryos be made the starting point but you forget that the real life embryo of the German nation has grown so far only inside its cranium"
"In a word You can not abolish aufheben philosophy without making it a reality"
"The same mistake but with the factors reversed was made by the theoretical party originating from philosophy"
"In the present struggle it saw only the critical struggle of philosophy against the German world it did not give a thought to the fact that philosophy up to the present itself belongs to this world and is its completion although an ideal one"
"Critical towards its counterpart it was uncritical towards itself when proceeding from the premises of philosophy it either stopped at the results given by philosophy or passed off demands and results from somewhere else as immediate demands and results of philosophy although these provided they are justified can be obtained only by the negation of philosophy up to the present of philosophy as such"
"We reserve ourselves the right to a more detailed description of this section It thought it could make philosophy a reality without abolishing aufzuheben it"
"The criticism of the German philosophy of state and right which attained its most consistent richest and last formulation through Hegel is both a critical analysis of the modern state and of the reality connected with it and the resolute negation of the whole manner of the German consciousness in politics and right as practiced hereto the most distinguished most universal expression of which raised to the level of science is the speculative philosophy of right itself"
"If the speculative philosophy of right that abstract extravagant thinking on the modern state the reality of which remains a thing of the beyond if only beyond the Rhine was possible only in Germany inversely the German thought image of the modern state which makes abstraction of real man was possible only because and insofar as the modern state itself makes abstraction of real man or satisfies the whole of man only in imagination"
"In politics the Germans thought what other nations did"
"Germany was their theoretical conscience"
"The abstraction and presumption of its thought was always in step with the one sidedness and lowliness of its reality"
"If therefore the status quo of German statehood expresses the completion of the ancien régime the completion of the thorn in the flesh of the modern state the status quo of German state science expresses the incompletion of the modern state the defectiveness of its flesh itself"
"It is asked can Germany attain a practice à la hauteur des principles i.e. a revolution which will raise it not only to the official level of modern nations but to the height of humanity which will be the near future of those nations"
"The weapon of criticism can not of course replace criticism of the weapon material force must be overthrown by material force but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses"
"Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad hominem and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical"
"But for man the root is man himself"
"The evident proof of the radicalism of German theory and hence of its practical energy is that is proceeds from a resolute positive abolition of religion"
"The criticism of religion ends with the teaching that man is the highest essence for man hence with the categoric imperative to overthrow all relations in which man is a debased enslaved abandoned despicable essence relations which can not be better described than by the cry of a Frenchman when it was planned to introduce a tax on dogs Poor dogs"
"They want to treat you as human beings"
"Even historically theoretical emancipation has specific practical significance for Germany"
"For Germany ’s revolutionary past is theoretical it is the Reformation"
"As the revolution then began in the brain of the monk so now it begins in the brain of the philosopher"
"Luther we grant overcame bondage out of devotion by replacing it by bondage out of conviction"
"He shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith"
"He turned priests into laymen because he turned laymen into priests"
"He freed man from outer religiosity because he made religiosity the inner man"
"He freed the body from chains because he enchained the heart"
"It was no longer a case of the layman ’s struggle against the priest outside himself but of his struggle against his own priest inside himself his priestly nature"
"And if the Protestant transformation of the German layman into priests emancipated the lay popes the princes with the whole of their priestly clique the privileged and philistines the philosophical transformation of priestly Germans into men will emancipate the people"
"But secularization will not stop at the confiscation of church estates set in motion mainly by hypocritical Prussia any more than emancipation stops at princes"
"The Peasant War the most radical fact of German history came to grief because of theology"
"Today when theology itself has come to grief the most unfree fact of German history our status quo will be shattered against philosophy"
"On the eve of the Reformation official Germany was the most unconditional slave of Rome"
"On the eve of its revolution it is the unconditional slave of less than Rome of Prussia and Austria of country junkers and philistines"
"Meanwhile a major difficulty seems to stand in the way of a radical German revolution"
"For revolutions require a passive element a material basis"
"Theory is fulfilled in a people only insofar as it is the fulfilment of the needs of that people"
"But will the monstrous discrepancy between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality find a corresponding discrepancy between civil society and the state and between civil society and itself"
"Will the theoretical needs be immediate practical needs"
"It is not enough for thought to strive for realization reality must itself strive towards thought"
"But Germany did not rise to the intermediary stage of political emancipation at the same time as the modern nations"
"It has not yet reached in practice the stages which it has surpassed in theory"
"How can it do a somersault not only over its own limitations but at the same time over the limitations of the modern nations over limitations which it must in reality feel and strive for as for emancipation from its real limitations"
"Only a revolution of radical needs can be a radical revolution and it seems that precisely the preconditions and ground for such needs are lacking"
"If Germany has accompanied the development of the modern nations only with the abstract activity of thought without taking an effective share in the real struggle of that development it has on the other hand shared the sufferings of that development without sharing in its enjoyment or its partial satisfaction"
"That is why Germany will one day find itself on the level of European decadence before ever having been on the level of European emancipation"
"It will be comparable to a fetish worshipper pining away with the diseases of Christianity"
"If we now consider the German governments we find that because of the circumstances of the time because of Germany ’s condition because of the standpoint of German education and finally under the impulse of its own fortunate instinct they are driven to combine the civilized shortcomings of the modern state world the advantages of which we do not enjoy with the barbaric deficiencies of the ancien régime which we enjoy in full hence Germany must share more and more if not in the reasonableness at least in the unreasonableness of those state formations which are beyond the bounds of its status quo"
"Is there in the world for example a country which shares so naively in all the illusions of constitutional statehood without sharing in its realities as so called constitutional Germany"
"And was it not perforce the notion of a German government to combine the tortures of censorship with the tortures of the French September laws 1835 anti press laws which provide for freedom of the press"
"As you could find the gods of all nations in the Roman Pantheon so you will find in the Germans Holy Roman Empire all the sins of all state forms"
"Germany as the deficiency of the political present constituted a world of its own will not be able to throw down the specific German limitations without throwing down the general limitation of the political present"
"It is not the radical revolution not the general human emancipation which is a utopian dream for Germany but rather the partial the merely political revolution the revolution which leaves the pillars of the house standing"
"On what is a partial a merely political revolution based"
"On part of civil society emancipating itself and attaining general domination on a definite class proceeding from its particular situation undertaking the general emancipation of society"
"This class emancipates the whole of society but only provided the whole of society is in the same situation as this class e.g. possesses money and education or can acquire them at will"
"No class of civil society can play this role without arousing a moment of enthusiasm in itself and in the masses a moment in which it fraternizes and merges with society in general becomes confused with it and is perceived and acknowledged as its general representative a moment in which its claims and rights are truly the claims and rights of society itself a moment in which it is truly the social head and the social heart"
"Only in the name of the general rights of society can a particular class vindicate for itself general domination"
"For the storming of this emancipatory position and hence for the political exploitation of all sections of society in the interests of its own section revolutionary energy and spiritual self feeling alone are not sufficient"
"For the revolution of a nation and the emancipation of a particular class of civil society to coincide for one estate to be acknowledged as the estate of the whole society all the defects of society must conversely be concentrated in another class a particular estate must be the estate of the general stumbling block the incorporation of the general limitation a particular social sphere must be recognized as the notorious crime of the whole of society so that liberation from that sphere appears as general self liberation"
"For one estate to be par excellence the estate of liberation another estate must conversely be the obvious estate of oppression"
"The negative general significance of the French nobility and the French clergy determined the positive general significance of the nearest neighboring and opposed class of the bourgeoisie"
"But no particular class in Germany has the constituency the penetration the courage or the ruthlessness that could mark it out as the negative representative of society"
"No more has any estate the breadth of soul that identifies itself even for a moment with the soul of the nation the geniality that inspires material might to political violence or that revolutionary daring which flings at the adversary the defiant words I am nothing"
"but I must be everything"
"The main stem of German morals and honesty of the classes as well as of individuals is rather that modest egoism which asserts its limitedness and allows it to be asserted against itself"
"The relation of the various sections of German society is therefore not dramatic but epic"
"Each of them begins to be aware of itself and begins to camp beside the others with all its particular claims not as soon as it is oppressed but as soon as the circumstances of the time without the section ’s own participation creates a social substratum on which it can in turn exert pressure"
"Even the moral self feeling of the German middle class rests only on the consciousness that it is the common representative of the philistine mediocrity of all the other classes"
"It is therefore not only the German kings who accede to the throne mal à propos it is every section of civil society which goes through a defeat before it celebrates victory and develops its own limitations before it overcomes the limitations facing it asserts its narrow hearted essence before it has been able to assert its magnanimous essence thus the very opportunity of a great role has passed away before it is to hand and"
"every class once it begins the struggle against the class opposed to it is involved in the struggle against the class below it"
"Hence the higher nobility is struggling against the monarchy the bureaucrat against the nobility and the bourgeois against them all while the proletariat is already beginning to find itself struggling against the bourgeoisie"
"The middle class hardly dares to grasp the thought of emancipation from its own standpoint when the development of the social conditions and the progress of political theory already declare that standpoint antiquated or at least problematic"
"In France it is enough for somebody to be something for him to want to be everything in Germany nobody can be anything if he is not prepared to renounce everything"
"In France partial emancipation is the basis of universal emancipation in Germany universal emancipation is the conditio sine qua non of any partial emancipation"
"In France it is the reality of gradual liberation that must give birth to complete freedom in Germany the impossibility of gradual liberation"
"The role of emancipator therefore passes in dramatic motion to the various classes of the French nation one after the other until it finally comes to the class which implements social freedom no longer with the provision of certain conditions lying outside man and yet created by human society but rather organizes all conditions of human existence on the premises of social freedom"
"On the contrary in Germany where practical life is as spiritless as spiritual life is unpractical no class in civil society has any need or capacity for general emancipation until it is forced by its immediate condition by material necessity by its very chains"
"Where then is the positive possibility of a German emancipation"
"In the formulation of a class with radical chains a class of civil society which is not a class of civil society an estate which is the dissolution of all estates a sphere which has a universal character by its universal suffering and claims no particular right because no particular wrong but wrong generally is perpetuated against it which can invoke no historical but only human title which does not stand in any one sided antithesis to the consequences but in all round antithesis to the premises of German statehood a sphere finally which can not emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all other spheres of society and thereby emancipating all other spheres of society which in a word is the complete loss of man and hence can win itself only through the complete re winning of man"
"This dissolution of society as a particular estate is the proletariat"
"The proletariat is beginning to appear in Germany as a result of the rising industrial movement"
"For it is not the naturally arising poor but the artificially impoverished not the human masses mechanically oppressed by the gravity of society but the masses resulting from the drastic dissolution of society mainly of the middle estate that form the proletariat although as is easily understood the naturally arising poor and the Christian Germanic serfs gradually join its ranks"
"By heralding the dissolution of the hereto existing world order the proletariat merely proclaims the secret of its own existence for it is the factual dissolution of that world order"
"By demanding the negation of private property the proletariat merely raises to the rank of a principle of society what society has raised to the rank of its principle what is already incorporated in it as the negative result of society without its own participation"
"The proletarian then finds himself possessing the same right in regard to the world which is coming into being as the German king in regard to the world which has come into being when he calls the people his people as he calls the horse his horse"
"By declaring the people his private property the king merely proclaims that the owner of property is king"
"And once the lightning of thought has squarely struck this ingenuous soil of the people the emancipation of the Germans into men will be accomplished"
"The only liberation of Germany which is practically possible is liberation from the point of view of that theory which declares man to be the supreme being for man"
"Germany can emancipate itself from the Middle Ages only if it emancipates itself at the same time from the partial victories over the Middle Ages"
"In Germany no form of bondage can be broken without breaking all forms of bondage"
"Germany which is renowned for its thoroughness can not make a revolution unless it is a thorough one"
"The emancipation of the German is the emancipation of man"
"The head of this emancipation is philosophy its heart the proletariat"
"Philosophy can not realize itself without the transcendence Aufhebung of the proletariat and the proletariat can not transcend itself without the realization Verwirklichung of philosophy"
"When all the inner conditions are met the day of the German resurrection will be heralded by the crowing of the cock of Gaul"

"An article has appeared in the 60th issue of the Vorwarts"
"with the The King of Prussia and Social Reform and it is signed by A Prussian"
"This so called Prussian begins by reporting the contents of the Royal Prussian Order in Council on the subject of the workers uprising in Silesia 2 and goes on to give the opinion of the French journal La Reforme 3 of the same Prussian Order in Council"
"The Reforme he says discerns the origins of the Order in Council in the King ’s panic and his religious sentiments"
"It even hails this document as a presentiment of the great reforms imminent in bourgeois society"
"The Prussian delivers the following lecture to the Reforme"
"Neither the King nor German society has had any presentiment of its reform 4"
"not even the uprisings in Bohemia and Silesia have managed to arouse such feelings"
"In an unpolitical country like Germany it is not possible to represent the sporadic misery of the factory districts as a matter of universal concern let alone as a disaster to the whole civilized world"
"As far as the Germans are concerned these events belong in the same category as any local shortage of food or water"
"In accordance with this the King views it as a failure of the administration or of charitable institutions"
"For this reason and because but few troops were needed to deal with the feeble weavers the destruction of factories and machines does not make the King and the authorities panic"
"Nor were religious sentiments responsible for the Order in Council it was instead a very sober expression of Christian statesmanship and of a doctrine which does not permit any obstacles to stand in the way of its only remedy the good intentions of Christian hearts"
"Poverty and crimes are two great evils who can provide a cure for them"
"The state and the authorities"
"But the union of all Christian hearts can do so"
"Our so called Prussian denies that the King panicked for a number of reasons among them being the fact that few troops were needed to deal with the feeble weavers"
"This means that in a country where banquets with liberal toasts and liberal champagne froth provoke Royal Orders in Council as we saw in the case of the Dusseldorf banquet 5 where the burning desire of the entire liberal bourgeoisie for freedom of the press and a constitution could be surpassed without the aid of a single soldier in a country where passive obedience is the order of the day can it be anything but an event and indeed a terrifying event when armed troops have to be called out against feeble wavers"
"And in the first encounter the feeble weavers even gained a victory"
"They were only suppressed when reinforcements were brought up"
"Is the uprising of a mass of workers less dangerous because it can be defeated without the aid of a whole army"
"Our sharp witted Prussian should compare the revolt of the Silesian weavers with the uprisings of English workers"
"The Silesians will then stand revealed as strong weavers"
"A consideration of the general relationship between politics and the defects of society will enable us to explain why the weavers could not induce any great panic in the King"
"For the present however we will only point out that the uprising was directed in the first instance not against the King of Prussia but against the bourgeoisie"
"As an aristocrat and an absolute monarch the King of Prussia can have no love of the bourgeoisie even less can he feel any anxiety if the submissiveness and impotence of the bourgeoisie is increased by its tense and difficult relationship with the proletariat"
"Similarly an orthodox Catholic will feel a greater hostility towards an orthodox Protestant than towards an atheist just as a legitimist will dislike a liberal more than a communist"
"The direct political antagonist of the King of Prussia in his role as politician is to be found in liberalism"
"For the King the antagonism of the proletariat exists no more than does the King for the proletariat"
"This means that if the proletariat has contrived to eliminate such antipathies and political antagonisms and to attract the entire hostility of the political powers towards itself it must have acquired a very definite power"
"Lastly the King ’s appetite for interesting and significant phenomena is well known"
"and it must have been a very pleasant surprise for him to discover such an interesting and much discussed pauperism within his very own frontiers and thus to find yet another opportunity to appear in the public eye"
"How he must have rejoiced to hear the news that he too now possessed his own Royal Prussian pauperism"
"Our Prussian is even less fortunate when he denies that religious sentiment was responsible for the Royal Order in Council"
"Why is religious sentiment not the source of this Order in Council"
"Because the latter was the very sober expression of Christian statesmanship a sober expression of the doctrine whose only remedy the good intentions of Christian hearts does not permit any obstacles to stand in its way"
"Is not religious sentiment the source of Christian statesmanship"
"Is it not true that a doctrine which possesses a universal panacea in the good intentions of Christian hearts is founded on religious sentiments"
"Is it true that the expression of religious feelings ceases to be the expression of religious feelings ceases to be the expression of religious feelings if it is sober"
"I would go even further"
"I would maintain that any religious feelings that contest the ability of the state and the authorities to remedy great evils while they themselves seek a cure in the union of Christian hearts must be conceited and drunk in the extreme"
"Only very drunk religious feelings could locate the course of the evil as does our Prussian in the absence of the Christian spirit"
"Such feelings alone could suggest that the authorities should resort to exhortation as the only means whereby the Christian spirit might be fortified"
"According to the Prussian Christian sentiment is the sole end aim of the Order in Council"
"Religious sentiment when it is drunk of course not when it is sober considers itself to be the only good"
"Whenever it comes across evil it attributes it to its own absence for if it is the only good then it alone can create the good"
"Therefore an Order in Council dictated by religious feelings logically enough itself decrees religious feelings"
"A politician with sober religious feelings would not attempt to find a cure for his own perplexity in the exhortations of the pious Preacher to cultivate Christian sentiments"
"How then does out so called Prussian demonstrate to the Reforme that the Order in Council is not an emanation of religious feeling"
"By describing it as an emanation of religious feeling"
"What insight into social movements can be expected from such an illogical mind"
"Let us listen to him gossiping about the relationship of German society to the workers movement and social reform in general"
"Let us distinguish as our Prussian fails to do let us distinguish between the various categories subsumed by the expression German society government bourgeoisie the press and finally the workers themselves"
"These are the various masses we are concerned with here"
"The Prussia merges them all into one mass and condemns them en masses from his exalted standpoint"
"According to him German society has not even had a presentiment of its reform"
"Why is it so lacking in this instinct"
"Because the Prussian explains"
"In an unpolitical country like Germany it is not possible to represent the sporadic misery of the factory districts as a matter of universal concern let alone as a disaster to the whole civilized world"
"As far as the Germans are concerned these events belong in the same category as any local shortage of food or water"
"In accordance with this the King views it as a failure of the administration or of charitable institutions"
"The Prussian thus explain this absurd interpretation of the plight of the workers with reference to the peculiar nature of an unpolitical country"
"It will be granted that England is a political nation"
"It will further be granted that England is the nation of pauperism the work itself is English in origin"
"An examination of the situation in England is thus the most certain way whereby to discover the relation of a political nation to pauperism"
"In England the misery of the workers is not sporadic but universal it is not confined to the factory districts but extends to country districts too"
"Workers movements are not in their infancy but have recurred periodically for close on a century"
"What then is the view of pauperism taken by the English bourgeoisie and the government and the press concerned with it"
"In so far as the English bourgeoisie regards pauperism as the fault of politics the Whigs put the blame on the Tories and the Tories put it on the Whigs"
"According to the Whigs the chief cause of pauperism is to be discovered in the monopoly of landed property property and in the laws prohibiting the import of grain"
"Neither party discovers the explanation in politics itself but only in the politics of the other party"
"Neither party would even dream of a reform of society as a whole"
"The most decisive expression of the insight of the English into pauperism and by the English we mean the English bourgeoisie and the government is to be found in English Political Economy i.e. the scientific reflection of the state of the economy in England"
"MacCulloch a pupil of the cynic Ricardo and one of the best and most celebrated of the English economists is familiar with the present state of affairs and has no overall view of the movement of bourgeois society"
"In a public lecture amidst applause he had the temerity to apply to political economy what Bacon had said of philosophy"
"The man who suspends his judgment with true and untiring wisdom who progresses gradually and who successively surmounts obstacles which impede the course of study like mountains will in time reach the summit of knowledge where rest and pure air may be enjoyed where Nature may be viewed in all her beauty and whence one may descend by an easy path to the final details of practice"
"The great natural beauty of the fantastic rags in which the english poor are clothes and of the faded shrivelled flesh of the women worn out by work and want the children lying on dung heaps the stunted monsters produced by overwork in the mechanical monotony of the factories"
"The most charming final details of practice prostitution murder and the gallows"
"Even that section of the English bourgeoisie which is conscious of the dangers of pauperism regards both the dangers and the means for remedying them not merely as particular problems but to put it bluntly in a childish and absurd manner"
"He argues that the worker ’s lack of education prevents him from understanding the natural laws of trade laws which necessarily reduce him to pauperism"
"For this reason the worker rises up in rebellion"
"And this rebellion may well cause embarrassment to the prosperity of the English manufactures and English commerce impair the mutual confidence of businessmen and diminish the stability of political and social institutions"
"This is the extent of the insanity of the English bourgeoisie and its press on the subject of pauperism the national epidemic of England"
"Let us assume for the moment that the criticism levelled by our Prussian at German society are justified"
"Is it true that their explanation is to be found in the unpolitical nature of Germany"
"But if the bourgeoisie of an unpolitical Germany is unable to achieve clarity about the general significance of universal misery of misery whose general meaning has become apparent partly by virtue of its periodic recurrence in time partly by its extension in space and partly by the failure of every attempt to eliminate it"
"The Prussian heaps further obloquy on the unpolitical nature of Germany because the King of Prussia has located the cause of pauperism in failures of the administration or of charitable institutions and has therefore looked to administrative or charitable measures to provide a cure for pauperism"
"Let us again look briefly at England the only country where these has been any large scale action against pauperism worth mentioning"
"The present English Poor Laws date from Act 43 of the reign of Elizabeth"
"7 how does this legislation propose to deal with pauperism"
"By obliging the parishes to support their own poor workers by the Poor Rate by legal charity"
"Charity dispensed by the administration this has been the method in force for two centuries"
"It therefore provides for a reform of the administration of the Poor Rate by officials of the different parishes"
"Unions of about 20 parishes are to be set up under a central administration"
"On a specified day the Board of Guardians consisting of officials elected by t he tax payers are to assemble at the headquarters of the union and decide on eligibility for relief"
"These Boards are presided over and controlled by government representatives from the Central Commission at Somerset House the Ministry of Pauperism to use the phrase aptly coined by a Frenchman Eugen Buret"
"The capital so administered is almost equal to the sum required by the War Office in France"
"The number of local offices thus maintained amounts to 500 and each of these local offices keeps at least 12 official busy"
"The English Parliament did not rest content with the formal reform of the administration"
"The chief cause of the acute condition of English pauperism was found to lie in the Poor Law itself"
"It was discovered that charity the legal method of combating social evils itself fostered social evils"
"As for pauperism in general it was held to be an eternal laws of nature in accordance with Malthus theory"
"Since the population threatens unceasingly to exceed the available means of subsistence benevolence is folly an open encouragement to misery"
"The state therefore can do nothing but leave misery to its fate and at best facilitate the death of those in want"
"The English Parliament combined this philanthropic theory with the view that pauperism is a state of misery brought on by the workers themselves and that in consequence it should not be regarded as a misfortune to be prevented but as a crime to be suppressed and punished"
"In this way the system of the workhouse came into being i.e. houses for the poor whose internal arrangements were devised to deter the indigent from seeking a refuge from starvation"
"In the workhouses charity has been ingeniously combined with the revenge of the bourgeoisie on all those wretched enough to appeal to their charity"
"Initially England attempted to eliminate pauperism by means of charity and administrative measures"
"It then came to regard the progressive increase in pauperism not as the inevitable consequence of modern industry but rather as the consequence of the English Poor Law"
"It construed the state of universal need as merely a particular feature of English law"
"What was formerly attributed to a deficiency of charity was now ascribed to the superabundance of charity"
"Lastly need was regarded as the fault of the needy and punishable as such"
"This administrative system has abandoned all attempts to stop pauperism at its source through positive measures it confines itself to preparing a grave for it with true police mildness as soon as it erupts on the surface of officialdom"
"Far from advancing beyond administrative and charitable measures the English state has regressed to a far more primitive position"
"It dispenses its administrative gifts only to that pauperism which is induced by despair to allow itself to be caught and incarcerated"
"Thus far the Prussian has failed to show that the procedure adopted by the King of Prussia has any features peculiar to it"
"But why our great man now exclaims with rare naivety Why does the King not decree the education of all deprived children at a stroke"
"Why must he turn first to the authorities with requests for their plans and proposals"
"Our all too clever Prussian will regain his composure when he realizes that in acting thus the King of Prussia is just as unoriginal as in all his other actions"
"In fact he has taken the only course of action open to the head of a state"
"Napoleon wished to do away with begging at a single stroke"
"He instructed his officials to prepare plans for the abolition of beggary throughout the whole of France"
"The project was subject to delay napoleon became impatient he wrote to Cretet his Minister of the Interior he commanded him to get rid of begging within a month"
"Do not ask me for another three or four months to obtain information you have young advocates clever prefects expert engineers of bridges and roads"
"Set them all in motion do not fall into the sleepy inactivity of routine office work"
"Within a few months everything was ready"
"On July 5 1808 the law to suppress begging was enacted"
"By means of the depots which were so speedily transformed into penal institutions that in a short time the poor man could gain access to one only via a police court"
"Nevertheless M. Noailles du Gard a member of the legislative body was able to declare"
"Eternal gratitude to the hero who has found a refuge for the needy and the means of life for the poor"
"Childhood will no longer be abandoned poor families will no longer lack resources not will workers go without encouragements and employment"
"Nos pas ne seront plus arretes"
"degoutante des infirmites et de la honteuse misere"
"We will no longer be hampered by the disgusting sight of illness and shameful misery"
"This last cynical statement is the only truth contained in this eulogy"
"If Napoleon can turn to his advocates prefects and engineers for counsel why should not the King of Prussia turn to his authorities"
"Why did not Napoleon simply decree the abolition of beggary at a stroke"
"This question is just as valid as that of our Prussian who asks Why does the King not decree the education of all deprived children at a stroke"
"Does the Prussian understand what the King would have to decree"
"the abolition of the proletariat"
"To educate children it is necessary to feed them and free them from the need to earn a livelihood"
"The feeding and educating of the entire future proletariat would mean the abolition of the proletariat and pauperism"
"For a moment the Convention had the courage to decree the abolition of pauperism not indeed at a stroke as the Prussian requires of his King but only after instructing the Committee of Public Safety to draw up the necessary plans and proposals and after the latter had made use of the extensive investigation by the Constituent Assembly into the state of poverty in France and through Barer had proposed the establishment of the Livre de la beinfaisance nationale Book of national charity etc"
"What was achieved by the decree of the Convention"
"Simply that there was now one decree more in the world and that one year later starving women besieged the Convention"
"The Convention however represented the maximum of political energy political power and political understanding"
"No government in the whole world has issued decrees about pauperism at a stroke and without consulting authorities"
"The English Parliament even sent emissaries to all the countries in Europe in order to discover the different administrative remedies in use"
"But in their attempts to come to grips with pauperism every government has struck fast at charitable and administrative measures or even regressed to a more primitive stage than that"
"The state will never discover the source of social evils in the state and the organization of society as the Prussian expects of his King"
"Wherever there are political parties each party will attribute every defect of society to the fact that its rival is at the helm of the state instead of itself"
"Even the radical and revolutionary politicians look for the causes of evil not in the nature of the state but in a specific form of the state which they would like to replace with another form of the state"
"From a political point of view the state and the organization of society are not two different things"
"In so far as the state acknowledges the existence of social grievances it locates their origins either in the laws of nature over which no human agency has control or in private life which is independent of the state or else in malfunctions of the administration which is dependent on it"
"Thus England finds poverty to be based on the law of nature according to which the population must always outgrow the available means of subsistence"
"Hence England punishes the poor the Kings of Prussia exhorts the rich and the Convention heheads the proprietors"
"Lastly all states seek the cause in fortuitous or intentional defects in the administration and hence the cure is sought in administrative measures"
"Because the administration is the organizing agency of the state"
"The contradiction between the vocation and the good intentions of the administration on the one hand and the means and powers at its disposal on the other can not be eliminated by the state except by abolishing itself for the state is based on this contradiction"
"It is based on the contradiction between public and private life between universal and particular interests"
"For this reason the state must confine itself to formal negative activities since the scope of its own power comes to an end at the very point where civil life and work begin"
"For the fragmentation the depravity and the slavery of civil society is the natural foundation of the modern state just as the civil society of slavery was the natural foundation of the state in antiquity"
"The existence of the state is inseparable from the existence of slavery"
"The state and slavery in antiquity frank and open classical antitheses were not more closely welded together than the modern state and the cut throat world of modern business sanctimonious Christian antithesis"
"And to abolish private life it would have to abolish itself since it exists only as the antithesis of private life"
"However no living person believes the defects of his existence to be based on the principle the essential nature of his own life they must instead be grounded in circumstances outside his own life"
"Suicide is contrary to nature"
"If these modification are inadequate well that just shows that social ills are natural imperfections independent of man they are a law of God or else the will of private individuals is too degenerate to meet the good intentions of the administration halfway"
"And how perverse individuals are"
"They grumble about the government when it places limits on freedom and yet demand that the government should prevent the inevitable consequences of that freedom"
"Political understanding is just political understanding because its thought does not transcend the limits of politics"
"The sharper and livelier it is the more incapable is it of comprehending social problems"
"The classical period of political understanding is the French Revolution"
"Far from identifying the principle of the state as the source of social ills the heroes of the French Revolution held social ills to be the source of political problems"
"Thus Robespierre regarded great wealth and great poverty as an obstacle to pure democracy"
"He therefore wished to establish a universal system of Spartan frugality"
"The principle of politics is the will"
"The more one sided i.e. the more prefect political understanding is the more completely it puts its faith in the omnipotence of the will"
"the blinder it is towards the natural and spiritual limitations of the will the more incapable it becomes of discovering the real source of the evils of society"
"No further arguments are needed to prove that when the Prussian claims that the political understanding is destined to uncover the roots of social want in Germany he is indulging in vain illusions"
"It was foolish to expect the King of Prussia to exhibit a power not possessed by the Convention and Napoleon combined it was foolish to expect him to possess a vision which could cross all political frontiers a vision with which our clever Prussian is no better endowed than is his King"
"The entire declaration was all the more foolish as our Prussian admits"
"Fine words and fine sentiments are"
"cheap insight and successful actions are dear in this case they are more than dear they are quite unobtainable"
"If they are quite unobtainable then we should acknowledge the efforts of everyone who does what is possible in a given situation"
"For the rest I leave it to the reader ’s tact to determine whether the commercial jargon of cheap dear more than dear unobtainable are to be included in the category of fine words and fine sentiments"
"Even if we assume then that the Prussian ’s remarks about the German government and the German bourgeoisie the latter is presumably to be included in German society are well founded does this mean that this segment of society is more perplexed in Germany than in England and France"
"Is it possible to be more perplexed than in England for example where perplexity has been erected into a system"
"If workers uprisings were to break out today all over England the bourgeoisie and the government would not have any better solutions than those that were open to them in the last third of the 18th century"
"Their only solution is physical force and since the efficacy of physical force declines in geometric proportion to the growth of pauperism and of the proletariat ’s understanding the perplexity of the English necessarily increases in geometric proportion too"
"Lastly it is false factually false that the German bourgeoisie wholly fails to appreciate the general significance of the Silesian revolt"
"In a number of town the masters are making attempts to associate themselves with the journeymen"
"All the liberal German papers the organs of the liberal bourgeoisie are overflowing with statements about the organization of labor the reform of society criticism of monopolies and competition etc"
"All as a result of the workers movements"
"The newspapers of Trier Aachen Cologne Wesel Mannheim Breslau and even Berlin are publishing often quite sensible articles on social questions from which our Prussian could well profit"
"Indeed letters from Germany constantly express surprise at the lack of bourgeois resistance to social ideas and tendencies"
"If the Prussian were more conversant with the history of the social movement he would have asked the opposite question"
"Why does the German bourgeoisie attribute such relatively universal significance to sporadic and particular problems"
"How are we to explain why the proletariat should be shown such animosity and cynicism by the political bourgeoisie and such sympathy and lack of resistance by the unpolitical bourgeoisie"
"Now for the oracular utterances of the Prussian concerning the german workers"
"The German poor he observes wittily are no cleverer than the poor Germans i.e. they never look beyond their hearth their factory or their district they remain as yet untouched by the all pervading spirit of politics"
"In order to compare the situation of the German workers with that of the English and French workers the Prussian should have compared the first formation the beginnings of the French and English workers movement with the new born German movement"
"He fails to do this"
"Hence his entire argument amounts only to the trivial observation that e.g. industry in Germany is less advanced than in England or that the start of a movement looks different from it later development"
"He had wished to speak of the specific nature of the German workers movement but does not say a single word on the subject"
"He should consider the matter from the correct vantage point"
"He would then realize that not a single one of the French and English insurrections has had the same theoretical and conscious character as the Silesian weavers rebellion"
"This first of the Weaver ’s Song by Heinrich Heine that intrepid battle cry which does not even mention hearth factory or district but in which the proletariat at once proclaims its antagonism to the society of private property in the most decisive aggressive ruthless and forceful manner"
"The Silesian rebellion starts where the French and English workers finish namely with an understanding of the nature of the proletariat"
"This superiority stamps the whole episode"
"Not only were machines destroyed those competitors of the workers but also the account books the titles of ownership and whereas all other movements had directed their attacks primarily at the visible enemy namely the industrialists the Silesian workers turned also against the hidden enemy the bankers"
"Finally not one English workers uprising was carried out with such courage foresight and endurance"
"As for the German workers level of education or capacity for it I would point to Weitling ’s brilliant writings which surpass Proudhon ’s from a theoretical point of view however defective they may be in execution"
"If we compare the meek sober mediocrity of German political literature with this titanic and brilliant literary debut of the German workers if we compare these gigantic children ’s shows of the proletariat with the dwarf like proportions of the worn out political shoes of the German bourgeoisie we must predict a vigorous future for this German Cinderella"
"It must be granted that the German proletariat is the theoretician of the European proletariat just as the English proletariat is its economist and the French its politician"
"For just as the impotence of the German bourgeoisie is the political impotence of Germany so too the capacity of the German proletariat even apart from German theory is the social capacity of Germany"
"The disparity between the philosophical and political development of Germany is nothing abnormal"
"It is a necessary disparity"
"Only in socialism can a philosophical nation discover the praxis consonant with its nature and only in the proletariat can it discover the active agent of its emancipation"
"For the moment however I have neither time nor the will to lecture the Prussian on the relationship between German society and the social revolution and to show how this relationship explains on the one hand the feeble reaction of the German bourgeoisie to socialism and on the other hand the brilliant talents of the German proletariat for socialism"
"He can find the first rudiments necessary for an understanding of this phenomenon in my Introduction to the Critique of Hegel ’s Philosophy of Right in the Franco German Yearbooks"
"Thus the cleverness of the German poor stands in inverse ratio to the cleverness of the poor Germans"
"But people who make every object the occasion for stylistic exercises in public are misled by such formal activities into perverting the content while for its part the perverted content stamps the imprint of vulgarity upon the form"
"Thus the Prussian ’s attempt to discuss the workers unrest in Silesia in formal antithesis has led him into the greatest antitheses to the truth"
"Confronted with the initial outbreak of the Silesian revolt no man who thinks or loves the truth could regard the duty to play schoolmaster to the event as his primary task"
"Of course this requires scientific understanding and a certain love of mankind while the other procedure needs only a ready made phraseology saturated in an overweening love of oneself"
"Why does the Prussian treat the German workers with such disdain"
"Because he believes the whole problem namely the plight of the workers to have been as yet untouched by the all pervading spirit of politics"
"He dilates on his platonic love for the spirit of politics as follows"
"All rebellions that are sparked off by the disasterous isolation of men from the community and of their thoughts from social principles are bound to be suppressed amid a welter of blood and incomprehension"
"But once need produces understanding and once the political understanding of the German discovers the roots of social need then even in Germany these events will be felt to be the symptoms of a great upheaval"
"First of all we hope that the Prussian will permit us to make a stylistic comment"
"The first half asserts Once need produces understanding"
"The second half states"
"Once the political understanding discovers the roots of social need"
"The simple understanding of the first half of the antithesis becomes political understanding in the second just as the simple need of the first half becomes the social need of the second"
"Why has our master of style weighted the two halves of his antithesis so unequally"
"I do not think that he has reflected on the matter"
"I shall reveal his correct instinct to him"
"Had he written Once social need produces political understanding and once political understanding has discovered the roots of social need no impartial reader could have failed to see that this antithesis was nonsensical"
"To begin with everyone would have wondered why the anonymous author did not link social understanding with social need and political understanding with political need as the most elementary logic would require"
"But let us proceed to the issue itself"
"It is entirely false that social need produces political understanding"
"Indeed it is nearer the truth to say that political understanding is produced by social well being"
"Political understanding is something spiritual that is given to him that hath to the man who is already sitting on velvet"
"Our Prussian should take note of what M. Michael Chevalier a French economist has to say on the subject"
"Emancipation meant the removal of the control of public affairs the high civic military and religious functions from the hands of the privileged classes who had a monopoly of these functions"
"Wealthy and enlightened self sufficient and able to manage their own affairs they wished to evade the clutches of arbitrary rule"
"We have already demonstrated to our Prussian how inadequate political understanding is to the task of discovering the source of social need"
"One last word on his view of the matter"
"The more developed and the more comprehensive is the political understanding of a nation the more the proletariat will squander its energies at least in the initial stages of the movement in senseless futile uprisings that will be drowned in blood"
"Because it thinks in political terms it regards the will as the cause of all evils and force and the overthrow of a particular form of the state as the universal remedy"
"Proof the first outbreaks of the French proletariat"
"The workers in Lyons imagined their goals were entirely political they saw themselves purely as soldiers of the republic while in reality they were the soldiers of socialism"
"Thus their political understanding obscured the roots of their social misery it falsified their insight into their real goal their political understanding deceived their social instincts"
"But if the Prussian expects understanding to be the result of misery why does he identify suppression in blood with suppression in incomprehension"
"If misery is a means whereby to produce understanding then a bloody slaughter must be a very extreme means to an end"
"The Prussian would have to argue that suppression in a welter of blood will stifle incomprehension and bring a breath of fresh air to the understanding"
"The Prussian predicts the suppression of the insurrections which are sparked off by the disasterous isolation of man from the community and of their thoughts from social principles"
"We have shown that in the Silesian uprising there was no separation of thoughts from social principles"
"That leaves the disasterous isolation of men from the community"
"By community is meant here the political community the state"
"It is the old song about unpolitical Germany"
"But do not all rebellions without exception have their roots in the disasterous isolation of man from the community"
"Does not every rebellion necessarily presuppose isolation"
"Would the revolution of 1789 have taken place if French citizens had not felt disasterously isolated from the community"
"The abolition of this isolation was its very purpose"
"But the community from which the workers is isolated is a community of quite different reality and scope than the political community"
"The community from which his own labor separates him is life itself physical and spiritual life human morality human activity human enjoyment human nature"
"Human nature is the true community of men"
"Just as the disasterous isolation from this nature is disproportionately more far reaching unbearable terrible and contradictory than the isolation from the political community so too the transcending of this isolation and even a partial reaction a rebellion against it is so much greater just as the man is greater than the citizen and human life than political life"
"Hence however limited an industrial revolt may be it contains within itself a universal soul and however universal a political revolt may be its colossal form conceals a narrow split"
"The Prussian brings his essay to a close worthy of it with the following sentence"
"A social revolution without a political soul i.e. without a central insight organizing it from the point of view of the totality is impossible"
"We have seen a social revolution possesses a total point of view because even if it is confined to only one factory district it represents a protest by man against a dehumanized life because it proceeds from the point of view of the particular real individual because the community against whose separation from himself"
"the individual is reacting is the true community of man human nature"
"In contrast the political soul of revolution consists in the tendency of the classes with no political power to put an end to their isolation from the state and from power"
"Its point of view is that of the state of an abstract totality which exists only through its separation from real life and which is unthinkable in the absence of an organized antithesis between the universal idea and the individual existence of man"
"In accordance with the limited and contradictory nature of the political soul a revolution inspired by it organizes a dominant group within society at the cost of society"
"We shall let the Prussian in on the secret of the nature of a social revolution with a political soul we shall thus confide to him the secret that not even his phrases raise him above the level of political narrow mindedness"
"Or else a social revolution with a political soul is nothing but a paraphrase of what is usually called a political revolution or a revolution pure and simple"
"Every revolution dissolves the old order of society to that extent it is social"
"Every revolution brings down the old ruling power to that extent it is political"
"The Prussian must choose between this paraphrase and nonsense"
"But whether the idea of a social revolution with a political soul is paraphrase or nonsense there is no doubt about the rationality of a political revolution with a social soul"
"All revolution the overthrow of the existing ruling power and the dissolution of the old order is a political act"
"It stands in need of this political act just as it stands in need of destruction and dissolution"
"But as soon as its organizing functions begin and its goal its soul emerges socialism throws its political mask aside"
"Such lengthy perorations were necessary to break through the tissue of errors concealed in a single newspaper column"
"In view of this does not our anonymous Prussian owe it to the reading public to give up writing on political and social themes and to refrain from making declamatory statements on the situation in Germany in order to devote himself to a conscientious analysis of his own situation"
"Marx note Particular circumstances make it necessary for me to declare that the present article is my first contribution to Vorwarts"
"This two part article was a reply to Marx ’s former co editor Arnold Ruge who was the anonymous Prussian who in Vorwarts"
"No.60 had written a piece generally playing down the Silesian weavers revolt and calling for state initiated reform to address their problems"

"I can not leave the soil of the Fatherland although only for a short time without expressing publicly the deeply felt gratitude in My and the Queen ’s name by which Our heart has been moved"
"It has been produced by the innumerable verbal and written proofs of the love for Us which the attempt of July 26 has evoked of the love which jubilantly acclaimed Us at the moment of the crime itself when the hand of the Almighty cast the deadly bullet away from My breast to the ground"
"While looking upwards to the divine Saviour I go with new courage about My daily work to complete what has been begun to carry out what has been prepared to combat evil with new certainty of victory and to be to My people what My high vocation imposes on Me and My people ’s love merits"
"Erdmannsdorf August 5 1844 signed"
"Immediate emotion is a bad writer"
"The letter which a lover writes in great excitement to his beloved is no model of style but it is just this confusion of expression that is the clearest most obvious and most moving expression of the power of love over the writer of the letter"
"The power of love over the letter writer is the power of hit beloved over him"
"That passionate unclarity and erratic confusion of style therefore flatters the heart of the beloved since the reflected general and therefore untrustworthy nature of the language has assumed a directly individual sensuously powerful and hence absolutely trustworthy character"
"The trusting faith in the truth of the love that the lover expresses for her however is the supreme joy of the loved one her faith in herself"
"From these premises it follows We perform an inestimable service for the Prussian people when we put the inner truth of the royal gratitude beyond all doubt"
"We put this truth beyond all doubt however by proving the force of the thankful feeling over the royal writer and we prove the force of this feeling over the royal writer by demonstrating the stylistic confusion of the cabinet edict in expressing thanks"
"Hence the aim of our patriotic analysis will not be misinterpreted"
"I can not leave the soil of the Fatherland although only for a short time without expressing publicly the deeply felt gratitude in My and the Queen ’s name by which Our heart has been moved"
"By the construction of the sentence it might be thought at first glance that the royal bosoms were moved by their own name"
"If amazement at this peculiar movement makes one think again one sees that the relative conjunction by which our heart has been moved refers not to the name but to the more remotely situated gratitude"
"The singular Our heart for the heart of the king and the heart of the queen can be justified as poetic licence as a cordial expression of the cordial unity of the cordial royal couple"
"The laconic brevity in My and the Queen ’s name instead of in My name and in the name of the Queen can easily lead to a false interpretation"
"My and the Queen ’s name could be understood to mean the simple name of the king since the name of the husband is the name of the husband and the wife"
"Thus Caesar could say Caesar conquered instead of I conquered"
"Thus children do not say I want to go to the school in Vienna but Friedrich Karl or Wilhelm etc wants to go to the school in Vienna"
"But it would be a dangerous innovation to make one ’s I the subject of the sentence and at the same time to give an assurance that this I speaks in his own name"
"Such an assurance could seem to contain a confession that one did not usually speak from one ’s own inspiration"
"I can not leave the soil of the Fatherland although only for a short time is neither a very skilful nor a more easily intelligible rephrasing of I can not leave the soil of the Fatherland even for a short time without etc"
"The difficulty is due to the combination of three ideas 1 that the king is leaving his homeland 2 that he is leaving it only for a short time 3 that he feels a need to thank the people"
"The too compressed utterance of these ideas makes it appear that the king expresses his gratitude only because he is leaving his homeland"
"But if the gratitude was seriously meant if it came from the heart then its utterance could not possibly be linked with such a chance occurrence"
"Under all circumstances the full heart speaks for itself"
"It the gratitude has been produced by the innumerable verbal and written proofs of the love for Us which the attempt of July 26 has evoked of the love which jubilantly acclaimed Us at the moment of the crime itself when the hand of the Almighty cast the deadly bullet away from My breast to the ground"
"It is not clear whether the attempt evoked the love or the proofs of the love the more sb because the genitive of the love after the parenthesis appears again as the governing and emphasised phrase in the sentence"
"The stylistic boldness of the repetition of the genitive is very noticeable"
"The difficulty increases when we examine the content of the sentence"
"Was it correct that the love which spoke and wrote was described directly as the subject which shouted in the street"
"Did not chronological truth require that one should begin with the love that was voiced at once in the presence of the occurrence and only then go on to the subsequent expressions of love in writing and speech"
"Should one not have avoided the suspicion that the king desires simultaneously to flatter both the aristocracy and the people"
"Lastly it does not seem altogether appropriate to cause the bullet to be warded off directly by the hand of God since in this way even a slight degree of consistent thought will arrive at the false conclusion that God at the same time both guided the hand of the criminal and diverted the bullet away from the king for how can one presume a one sided action on the part of God"
"While looking upwards to the divine Saviour I go with new courage about My daily work to complete what has been begun to carry out what has been prepared to combat evil with certainty of victory and to be to My people what My high vocation imposes on Me and My people ’s love merits"
"One can not very well say I go to be something"
"At the most one can go to become something"
"The motion involved in becoming appears at least as the result of the motion of going although we would not recommend even the latter turn of phrase as correct"
"That His Majesty goes while looking upwards to God to complete what has been begun to carry out what has been prepared does not seem to offer a good prospect for either the"
"One who truly goes while looking upwards to God will he not be completely absorbed by the sight of God"
"Will he not lose all interest in worldly plans and ideas"
"The isolated final phrase left on its own after a comma and My people ’s love merits seems to point to an unexpressed hidden subsequent clause something like merits the knout of my brother in law Nicholas and the policy of our neighbour Metternich or also merits the petty constitution devised by the knightly Bunsen"

"Written in the first half of 1844"
"First published in full in Marx Engels Gesamtausgabe Erste Abteilung Band 3 Berlin 1932"
"First English Translation by Clemens Dutt for the Collected Works"
"Marx used a translation of Mill ’s book by J. T. Parisot Paris 1823"
"Marx kept a wide variety of notebooks throughout his life"
"He often used them to aid in his study of other authors"
"A common practice was to transcribe long sections from a particular book and then comment on those sections at some length"
"They date from the end of 1843 to January 1845"
"The Paris Notebooks deal with books by J. B. Say Adam Smith David Ricardo McCulloch James Mill Destott de Tracy Sismondi Jeremy Bentham Boisguillebert Lauderdale Schütz List Skarbek and Buret"
"Most of Marx 's accompanying commentary on these authors is very fragmentary and ideas are often restated far more clearly in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts 1844"
"Marx used an 1823 French translation of Mill 's book"
"The Mill part of the Paris Notebooks is quite lengthy it starts on page 25 of the fourth notebook and continues into the fifth"
"Following a lengthy selection of Mill excerpts Marx suddenly veered off and began developing a larger tangential thought"
"After writing his thoughts out Marx returned to more Mill transcription"
"Soon a second digression followed"
"Upon its completion Marx finished up his summarizing"
"Some have suggested that the ideas contained herein might be a glimpse into the missing bulk of the EPM second manuscript"
"A medium of exchange is some one commodity which in order to effect an exchange between two other commodities is first received in exchange for the one and is then given in exchange for the other"
"By value of money is here to be understood the proportion in which it exchanges for other commodities or the quantity of it which exchanges for a certain quantity of other things"
"This proportion is determined by the total amount of money existing in a given country"
"What regulates the quantity of money"
"Money is made under two sets of circumstances Government either leaves the increase or diminution of it free or it controls the quantity making it greater or smaller as it pleases"
"When the increase or diminution of money is left free government opens the mint to the public making bullion into money for an many as require it"
"This can only happen when money is peculiarly valuable and when the same quantity of metal in the state of coin will exchange for a greater quantity of other articles than in the state of bullion"
"As the value of money depends upon the quantity of it it has a greater value when it is in short supply"
"It is then that bullion is made into coin"
"But precisely because of this conversion the old ratio is restored"
"Therefore if the value of money rises above that of the metal of which it is made the interest of individuals operates immediately in a state of freedom to restore the balance by augmenting the quantity of money"
"Whenever the coining of money therefore is free its quantity is regulated by the value of the metal it being the interest of individuals to increase or diminish the quantity in proportion as the value of the metal in coins is greater or less than its value in bullion"
"But is the quantity of money is determined by the value of the metal it is still necessary to inquire what it is which determines the value of the metal"
"Gold and silver are in reality commodities"
"They are commodities for the attaining of which labour and capital must be employed"
"It is cost of production therefore which determines the value of these as of other ordinary productions"
"In the compensation of money and value of metal as in his description of the cost of production as the only factor in determining value Mill commits the mistake like the school of Ricardo in general of stating the abstract law without the change or continual supersession of this law through which alone it comes into being"
"If it is a constant law that for example the cost of production in the last instance or rather when demand and supply are in equilibrium which occurs sporadically fortuitously determines the price value it is just as much a constant law that they are not in equilibrium and that therefore value and cost of production stand in no necessary relationship"
"Indeed there is always only a momentary equilibrium of demand and supply owing to the previous fluctuation of demand and supply owing to the disproportion between cost of production and exchange value just as this fluctuation and this disproportion likewise again follow the momentary state of equilibrium"
"This real movement of which that law is only an abstract fortuitous and one sided factor is made by recent political economy into something accidental and inessential"
"Because in the acute and precise formulas to which they reduce political economy the basic formula if they wished to express that movement abstractly would have to be In political economy law is determined by its opposite absence of law"
"The true law of political economy is chance from whose movement we the scientific men isolate certain factors arbitrarily in the form of laws"
"Mill very well expresses the essence of the matter in the form of a concept by characterising money as the medium of exchange"
"The essence of money is not in the first place that property is alienated in it but that the mediating activity or movement the human social act by which man 's products mutually complement one another is estranged from man and becomes the attribute of money a material thing outside man"
"Owing to this alien mediator instead of man himself being the mediator for man man regards his will his activity and his relation to other men as a power independent of him and them"
"His slavery therefore reaches its peak"
"It is clear that this mediator now becomes a real God for the mediator is the real power over what it mediates to me"
"Its cult becomes an end in itself"
"Objects separated from this mediator have lost their value"
"Hence the objects only have value insofar as they represent the mediator whereas originally it seemed that the mediator had value only insofar as it represented them"
"All the qualities which arise in the course of this activity are therefore transferred to this mediator"
"Christ represents originally 1 men before God 2 God for men 3 men to man"
"Similarly money represents originally in accordance with the idea of money 1 private property for private property 2 society for private property 3 private property for society"
"But Christ is alienated God and alienated man"
"God has value only insofar as he represents Christ and man has value only insofar as he represents Christ"
"It is the same with money"
"Because man as a social being must proceed to exchange and because exchange private property being presupposed must evolve value"
"The mediating process between men engaged in exchange is not a social or human process not human relationship it is the abstract relationship of private property to private property and the expression of this abstract relationship is value whose actual existence as value constitutes money"
"The social relationship of private property to private property is already a relationship in which private property is estranged from itself"
"The form of existence for itself of this relationship money is therefore the alienation of private property the abstraction from its specific personal nature"
"Hence the opposition of modern political economy to the monetary system the système monétaire 1 can not achieve any decisive victory in spite of all its cleverness"
"For if the crude economic superstition of the people and governments clings to the sensuous tangible conspicuous money bag and therefore believes both in the absolute value of the precious metals and possession of them as the sole reality of wealth and if then the enlightened worldly wise economist comes forward and proves to them that money is a commodity like any other the value of which like that of any other commodity depends therefore on the relation of the cost of production to demand competition and supply to the quantity or competition of the other commodities"
"this economist is given the correct reply that nevertheless the real value of things is their exchange value and this in the last instance exists in money as the latter does in the precious metals and that consequently money represents the true value of things and for that reason money is the most desirable thing"
"Indeed in the last instance the economist 's theory itself amounts to this wisdom the only difference being that he possesses the capacity of abstraction the capacity to recognise the existence of money under all forms of commodities and therefore not to believe in the exclusive value of its official metallic mode of existence"
"The metallic existence of money is only the official palpable expression of the soul of money which is present in all branches of production and in all activities of bourgeois society"
"The opposition of modern economists to the monetary system is merely that they have conceived the essence of money in its abstract universality and are therefore enlightened about the sensuous superstition which believes in the exclusive existence of this essence in precious metal"
"They substitute refined superstition for crude superstition"
"Since however in essence both have the same root the enlightened form of the superstition can not succeed in supplanting completely the crude sensuous form because the former does not attack the essence of the latter but only the particular form of this essence"
"The personal mode of existence of money as money and not only as the inner implicit hidden social relationship or class relationship between commodities this mode of existence corresponds the more to the essence of money the more abstract it is the less it has a natural relationship to the other commodities the more it appears as the product and yet as the non product of man the less primitive its sphere of existence the more it is created by man or in economic terms the greater the inverse relationship of its value as money to the exchange value or money value of the material in which it exists"
"Hence paper money and the whole number of paper representatives of money such as bills of exchange mandates promissory notes etc are the more perfect mode of existence of money as money and a necessary factor in the progressive development of the money system"
"In the credit system of which banking is the perfect expression it appears as if the power of the alien material force were broken the relationship of self estrangement abolished and man had once more human relations to man"
"The Saint Simonists deceived by this appearance regarded the development of money bills of exchange paper money paper representatives of money credit banking as a gradual abolition of the separation of man from things of capital from labour of private property from money and of money from man and of the separation of man from man"
"But this abolition of estrangement this return of man to himself and therefore to other men is only an appearance the self estrangement the dehumanisation is all the more infamous and extreme because its element is no longer commodity metal paper but man 's moral existence man 's social existence the inmost depths of his heart and because under the appearance of man 's trust in man it is the height of distrust and complete estrangement"
"What constitutes the essence of credit"
"We leave entirely out of account here the content of credit which is again money"
"Credit is conceivable in two relationships and under two different conditions"
"The two relationships are first a rich man gives credit to a poor man whom he considers industrious and decent"
"This kind of credit belongs to the romantic sentimental part of political economy to its aberrations excesses exceptions not to the rule"
"But even assuming this exception and granting this romantic possibility the life of the poor man and his talents and activity serve the rich man as a guarantee of the repayment of the money lent"
"That means therefore that all the social virtues of the poor man the content of his vital activity his existence itself represent for the rich man the reimbursement of his capital with the customary interest"
"Hence the death of the poor man is the worst eventuality for the creditor"
"It is the death of his capital together with the interest"
"One ought to consider how vile it is to estimate the value of a man in money as happens in the credit relationship"
"As a matter of course the creditor possesses besides moral guarantees also the guarantee of legal compulsion and still other more or less real guarantees for his man"
"If the man to whom credit is given is himself a man of means credit becomes merely a medium facilitating exchange that is to say money itself is raised to a completely ideal form"
"In credit the man himself instead of metal or paper has become the mediator of exchange not however as a man but as the mode of existence of capital and interest"
"The medium of exchange therefore has certainly returned out of its material form and been put back in man but only because the man himself has been put outside himself and has himself assumed a material form"
"Within the credit relationship it is not the case that money is transcended in man but that man himself is turned into money or money is incorporated in him"
"Human individuality human morality itself has become both an object of commerce and the material in which money exists"
"Instead of money or paper it is my own personal existence my flesh and blood my social virtue and importance which constitutes the material corporeal form of the spirit of money"
"Credit no longer resolves the value of money into money but into human flesh and the human heart"
"Such is the extent to which all progress and all inconsistencies within a false system are extreme retrogression and the extreme consequence of vileness"
"Within the credit system its nature estranged from man under the appearance of an extreme economic appreciation of man operates in a double way"
"The antithesis between capitalist and worker between big and small capitalists becomes still greater since credit is given only to him who already has and is a new opportunity of accumulation for the rich man or since the poor man finds that the arbitrary discretion of the rich man and the latter 's judgment over him confirm or deny his entire existence and that his existence is wholly dependent on this contingency"
"2 Mutual dissimulation hypocrisy and sanctimoniousness are carried to extreme lengths so that on the man without credit is pronounced not only the simple judgment that he is poor but in addition a pejorative moral judgment that he possesses no trust no recognition and therefore is a social pariah a bad man and in addition to his privation the poor man undergoes this humiliation and the humiliating necessity of having to ask the rich man for credit"
"3 Since owing to this completely nominal existence of money counterfeiting can not be undertaken by man in any other material than his own person he has to make himself into counterfeit coin obtain credit by stealth by lying etc and this credit relationship both on the part of the man who trusts and of the man who needs trust becomes an object of commerce an object of mutual deception and misuse"
"Here it is also glaringly evident that distrust is the basis of economic trust distrustful calculation whether credit ought to be given or not spying into the secrets of the private life etc of the one seeking credit the disclosure of temporary straits in order to overthrow a rival by a sudden shattering of his credit etc"
"The whole system of bankruptcy spurious enterprises etc"
"As regards government loans the state occupies exactly the same place as the man does in the earlier example"
"In the game with government securities it is seen how the state has become the plaything of businessmen etc"
"The credit system finally has its completion in the banking system"
"Owing to the fact that in the credit system the moral recognition of a man as also trust in the state etc take the form of credit the secret contained in the lie of moral recognition the immoral vileness of this morality as also the sanctimoniousness and egoism of that trust in the state become evident and show themselves for what they really are"
"Exchange both of human activity within production itself and of human product against one another is equivalent to species activity and species spirit the real conscious and true mode of existence of which is social activity and social enjoyment"
"Since human nature is the true community of men by manifesting their nature men create produce the human community the social entity which is no abstract universal power opposed to the single individual but is the essential nature of each individual his own activity his own life his own spirit his own wealth"
"Hence this true community does not come into being through reflection it appears owing to the need and egoism of individuals i.e. it is produced directly by their life activity itself"
"Men not as an abstraction but as real living particular individuals are this entity"
"To say that man is estranged from himself therefore is the same thing as saying that the society of this estranged man is a caricature of his real community of his true species life that his activity therefore appears to him as a torment his own creation as an alien power his wealth as poverty the essential bond linking him with other men as an unessential bond and separation from his fellow men on the other hand as his true mode of existence his life as a sacrifice of his life the realisation of his nature as making his life unreal his production as the production of his nullity his power over an object as the power of the object over him and he himself the lord of his creation as the servant of this creation"
"The community of men or the manifestation of the nature of men their mutual complementing the result of which is species life truly human life this community is conceived by political economy in the form of exchange and trade"
"Society says Destutt de Tracy is a series of mutual exchanges"
"It is precisely this process of mutual integration"
"Society says Adam Smith is a commercial society"
"Each of its members is a merchant"
"It is seen that political economy defines the estranged form of social intercourse as the essential and original form corresponding to man 's nature"
"If man is presupposed as property owner i.e. therefore as an exclusive owner who proves his personality and both distinguishes himself from and enters into relations with other men through this exclusive ownership private property is his personal distinctive and therefore essential mode of existence then the loss or surrender of private property is an alienation of man as it is of private property itself"
"Here we shall only be concerned with the latter definition"
"If I give up my private property to someone else it ceases to be mine it becomes something independent of me lying outside my sphere a thing external to me"
"Hence I alienate my private property"
"With regard to me therefore I turn it into alienated private property"
"But I only turn it into an alienated thing in general I abolish only my personal relation to it I give it back to the elementary powers of nature if I alienate it only with regard to myself"
"It becomes alienated private property only if while ceasing to be my private property it on that account does not cease to be private property as such that is to say if it enters into the same relation to another man apart from me as that which it had to myself in short if it becomes the private property of another man"
"The case of violence excepted what causes me to alienate my private property to another man"
"Political economy replies correctly necessity need"
"The other man is also a property owner but he is the owner of another thing which I lack and can not and will not do without which seems to me a necessity for the completion of my existence and the realisation of my nature"
"The bond which connects the two property owners with each other is the specific kind of object that constitutes the substance of their private property"
"The desire for these two objects i.e. the need for them shows each of the property owners and makes him conscious of it that he has yet another essential relation to objects besides that of private ownership that he is not the particular being that he considers himself to be but a total being whose needs stand in the relationship of inner ownership to all products including those of another 's labour"
"For the need of a thing is the most evident irrefutable proof that the thing belongs to my essence that its being is for me that its property is the property the peculiarity of my essence"
"Thus both property owners are impelled to give up their private property but to do so in such a way that at the same time they confirm private ownership or to give up the private property within that relationship of private ownership"
"Each therefore alienates a part of his private property to the other"
"The social connection or social relationship between the two property owners is therefore that of reciprocity in alienation positing the relationship of alienation on both sides or alienation as the relationship of both property owners whereas in simple private property alienation occurs only in relation to oneself one sidedly"
"Exchange or barter is therefore the social act the species act the community the social intercourse and integration of men within private ownership and therefore the external alienated species act"
"It is just for this reason that it appears as barter"
"For this reason likewise it is the opposite of the social relationship"
"Through the reciprocal alienation or estrangement of private property private property itself falls into the category of alienated private property.[2"
"For in the first place it has ceased to be the product of the labour of its owner his exclusive distinctive personality"
"For he has alienated it it has moved away from the owner whose product it was and has acquired a personal significance for someone whose product it is not"
"It has lost its personal significance for the owner"
"Secondly it has been brought into relation with another private property and placed on a par with the latter"
"Its place has been taken by a private property of a different kind just as it itself takes the place of a private property of a different kind"
"On both sides therefore private property appears as the representative of a different kind of private property as the equivalent of a different natural product and both sides are related to each other in such a way that each represents the mode of existence of the other and both relate to each other as substitutes for themselves and the other"
"Hence the mode of existence of private property as such has become that of a substitute of an equivalent"
"Instead of its immediate unity with itself it exists now only as a relation to something else"
"Its mode of existence as an equivalent is no longer its specific mode of existence"
"It has thus become a value and immediately an exchange value"
"Its mode of existence as value is an alienated designation of itself different from its immediate existence external to its specific nature a merely relative mode of existence of this"
"How this value is more precisely determined must be described elsewhere as also how it becomes price"
"The relationship of exchange being presupposed labour becomes directly labour to earn a living"
"This relationship of alienated labour reaches its highest point only when 1 on one side labour to earn a living and the product of the worker have no direct relation to his need or his function as worker but both aspects are determined by social combinations alien to the worker 2 he who buys the product is not himself a producer but gives in exchange what someone else has produced"
"In the crude form of alienated private property barter each of the property owners has produced what his immediate need his talents and the available raw material have impelled him to make"
"Each therefore exchanges with the other only the surplus of his production"
"It is true that labour was his immediate source of subsistence but it was at the same time also the manifestation of his individual existence"
"Through exchange his labour has become partly a source of income"
"Its purpose differs now from its mode of existence"
"The product is produced as value as exchange value as an equivalent and no longer because of its direct personal relation to the producer"
"The more diverse production becomes and therefore the more diverse the needs become on the one hand and the more one sided the activities of the producer become on the other hand the more does his labour fall into the category of labour to earn a living until finally it has only this significance and it becomes quite accidental and inessential whether the relation of the producer to his product is that of immediate enjoyment and personal need and also whether his activity the act of labour itself is for him the enjoyment of his personality and the realisation of his natural abilities and spiritual aims"
"4 that to the worker the maintenance of his individual existence appears to be the purpose of his activity and what he actually does is regarded by him only as a means that he carries on his life 's activity in order to earn means of subsistence"
"Just as the mutual exchange of the products of human activity appears as barter as trade so the mutual completion and exchange of the activity itself appears as division of labour which turns man as far as possible into an abstract being a machine tool etc and transforms him into a spiritual and physical monster"
"It is precisely the unity of human labour that is regarded merely as division of labour because social nature only comes into existence as its opposite in the form of estrangement"
"Division of labour increases with civilisation"
"The equivalent comes into existence as an equivalent in money which is now the immediate result of labour to gain a living and the medium of exchange see above"
"The complete domination of the estranged thing over man has become evident in money which is completely indifferent both to the nature of the material i.e. to the specific nature of the private property and to the personality of the property owner"
"What was the domination of person over person is now the general domination of the thing over the person of the product over the producer"
"Just as the concept of the equivalent the value already implied the alienation of private property so money is the sensuous even objective existence of this alienation"
"Needless to say that political economy is only able to grasp this whole development as a fact as the outcome of fortuitous necessity"
"The separation of work from itself separation of the worker from the capitalist separation of labour and capital the original form of which is made up of landed property and movable property"
"The original determining feature of private property is monopoly hence when it creates a political constitution it is that of monopoly"
"The perfect monopoly is competition"
"To the economist production consumption and as the mediator of both exchange or distribution are separate activities].[3"
"The separation of production and consumption of action and spirit in different individuals and in the same individual is the separation of labour from its object and from itself as something spiritual"
"Distribution is the power of private property manifesting itself"
"The separation of labour capital and landed property from one another like that of labour from labour of capital from capital and landed property from landed property and finally the separation of labour from wages of capital from profit and profit from interest and last of all of landed property from land rent demonstrate self estrangement both in the form of self estrangement and in that of mutual estrangement"
"We have next to examine the effects which take place by the attempts of government to control the increase or diminution of money"
"When it endeavours to keep the quantity of money less than it would be if things were left in freedom it raises the value of the metal in the coin and renders it the interest of every body who can to convert his bullion into money"
"People have recourse to private coining"
"On the other hand were it the object of government to keep the quantity of money greater than it would be if left in freedom it would reduce the value of the metal in money below its value in bullion and make it the interest of every body to melt the coins"
"This also the government would have only one expedient for preventing namely punishment"
"But the prospect of punishment will prevail over the prospect of profit only if the profit is small"

"that commodity which is the most generally bought and sold"
"Accordingly it depends on the value of the precious metals in a country whether they are imported or exported"
"Pp 128 129 p. 175 et seq"
"When we speak of the value of the precious metal we mean the quantity of other things for which it will exchange"
"This relation is different in different countries and even in different parts of the country"
"We say that living is more cheap in other words commodities may be purchased with a smaller quantity of money"

"Production Distribution Exchange are means"
"No man produces for the sale of producing distribution and exchange are only the intermediate operations for bringing the things which have been produced into the hands of those who are to consume them"
"P. 177 p. 237"
"Of Consumption there are two species"
"It includes everything expended for the sake of something to be produced and comprise the necessaries of the labourer"
"The second class then"
"machinery including tools the buildings necessary for the productive operations and even the cattle"
"The third is the material of which the commodity to be produced must be formed or from which it must be derived"
"Pp 178 179 pp 238 239"
"Of these three classes of things it is only the second the consumption of which is not completed in the course of the productive operations"
"The wages given to a footman and all consumption which does not take place to the end that something which may be an equivalent for it may be produced by means of it is unproductive consumption"
"Pp 179 180 p. 240"
"Productive consumption is itself a means it is a mean to production"
"Unproductive consumption is not a means"
"It is the end"

"By productive consumption nothing is lost"
"Whatever is unproductively consumed is lost"
"That which is productively consumed is always capital"
"The whole of what the productive powers of the country have brought into existence in the course of a year is called the gross annual produce"
"Of this the greater part is required to replace the capital which has been consumed"
"What remains of the gross produce after replacing the capital which has been consumed is called the net produce and is always distributed either as profits of stock or as rent"
"Pp 181 182 pp 242 243"
"This net produce is the fund from which all addition to the national capital is commonly made"
"the two species of consumption are matched by the two species of labour productive and unproductive"
"P. 182 p. 244"
"the whole of what is annually produced is annually consumed or"
"what is produced in one year is consumed in the next"
"Either productively or unproductively"
"P. 184 p. 246"
"Consumption is co extensive with production"
"A man produces only because he wishes to have"
"If the commodity which he produces is the commodity which he wishes to have he stops when he has produced as much as he wishes to have"
"When a man produces a greater quantity"
"than he desires for himself it can only be on one account namely that he desires some other commodity which he can obtain in exchange for the surplus of what he himself has produced"
"If a man desires one thing and produces another it can only be because the thing which he desires can be obtained by means of the thing which he produces and better obtained than if he had endeavoured to produce it himself"
"After labour has been divided"
"each producer confines himself to some one commodity or part of a commodity a small portion only of what he produces is used for his own consumption"
"The remainder he destines for the purpose of supplying him with all the other commodities which he desires and when each man confines himself to one commodity and exchanges what he produces for what is produced by other people it is found that each obtains more of the several things which he desires than he would have obtained had he endeavoured to produce them all for himself"
"In the case of the man who produces for himself there is no exchange"
"He neither offers to buy any thing nor to sell any thing"
"He has the property he has produced it and does not mean to part with it"
"If we apply by a sort of metaphor the terms demand and supply to this case it is implied"
"that the demand and supply are exactly proportioned to one another"
"As far then as regards the demand and supply of the market we may leave that portion of the annual produce which each of the owners consumes in the shape in which he produces or receives it altogether out of the question"
"In speaking here of demand and supply it is evident that we speak of aggregates"
"When we say of any particular nation at any particular time that its supply is equal to its demand we do not mean in any one commodity or any two commodities"
"We mean that the amount of its demand in all commodities taken together is equal to the amount of its supply in all commodities taken together"
"It may very well happen notwithstanding this equality in the general sum of demands and supplies that some one commodity or commodities may have been produced in a quantity either above or below the demand for those particular commodities"
"Two things are necessary to constitute a demand"
"These are A Wish for the commodity and An Equivalent to give for it"
"A demand means the will to purchase and the means of purchasing"
"If either is wanting the purchase does not take place"
"An equivalent is the necessary foundation of all demand"
"It is in vain that a man wishes for commodities if he has nothing to give for them"
"The equivalent which a man brings is the instrument of demand"
"The extent of his demand is measured by the extent of his equivalent"
"The demand and the equivalent are convertible terms and the one may be substituted for the other"
"We have already seen that every man who produces has a wish for other commodities than those which he has produced to the extent of all that he has produced beyond what he wishes to keep for his own consumption"
"And it is evident that whatever a man has produced and does not wish to keep for his own consumption is a stock which he may give in exchange for other commodities"
"His will therefore to purchase and his means of purchasing in other words his demand is exactly equal to the amount of what he has produced and does not mean to consume"
"Pp 188 89 pp 252 253"
"With his customary cynical acumen and clarity Mill here analyses exchange on the basis of private property"
"Man produces only in order to have this is the basic presupposition of private property"
"The aim of production is having"
"And not only does production have this kind of useful aim it has also a selfish aim man produces only in order to possess for himself the object he produces is the objectification of his immediate selfish need"
"Under these conditions therefore man produces no more than he immediately requires"
"The limit of his need forms the limit of his production"
"Thus demand and supply exactly coincide"
"The extent of his production is measured by his need"
"In this case no exchange takes place or exchange is reduced to the exchange of his labour for the product of his labour and this exchange is the latent form the germ of real exchange"
"As soon as exchange takes place a surplus is produced beyond the immediate limit of possession"
"But this surplus production does not mean rising above selfish need"
"On the contrary it is only an indirect way of satisfying a need which finds its objectification not in this production but in the production of someone else"
"Production has become a means of gaining a living labour to gain a living"
"Whereas under the first state of affairs therefore need is the measure of production under the second state of affairs production or rather ownership of the product is the measure of how far needs can be satisfied"
"I have produced for myself and not for you just as you have produced for yourself and not for me"
"In itself the result of my production has as little connection with you as the result of your production has directly with me"
"That is to say our production is not man 's production for man as a man i.e. it is not social production"
"Hence our exchange too can not be the mediating process by which it is confirmed that my product is for you because it is an objectification of your own nature your need"
"For it is not man 's nature that forms the link between the products we make for one another"
"Exchange can only set in motion only confirm the character of the relation which each of us has in regard to his own product and therefore to the product of the other"
"Each of us sees in his product only the objectification of his own selfish need and therefore in the product of the other the objectification of a different selfish need independent of him and alien to him"
"As a man you have of course a human relation to my product you have need of my product"
"Hence it exists for you as an object of your desire and your will"
"But your need your desire your will are powerless as regards my product"
"That means therefore that your human nature which accordingly is bound to stand in intimate relation to my human production is not your power over this production your possession of it for it is not the specific character not the power of man 's nature that is recognised in my production"
"They your need your desire etc"
"constitute rather the tie which makes you dependent on me because they put you in a position of dependence on my product"
"Far from being the means which would give you power over my production they are instead the means for giving me power over you"
"When I produce more of an object than I myself can directly use my surplus production is cunningly calculated for your need"
"It is only in appearance that I produce a surplus of this object"
"In reality I produce a different object the object of your production which I intend to exchange against this surplus an exchange which in my mind I have already completed"
"The social relation in which I stand to you my labour for your need is therefore also a mere semblance and our complementing each other is likewise a mere semblance the basis of which is mutual plundering"
"The intention of plundering of deception is necessarily present in the background for since our exchange is a selfish one on your side as on mine and since the selfishness of each seeks to get the better of that of the other we necessarily seek to deceive each other"
"It is true though that the power which I attribute to my object over yours requires your recognition in order to become a real power"
"Our mutual recognition of the respective powers of our objects however is a struggle and in a struggle the victor is the one who has more energy force insight or adroitness"
"If I have sufficient physical force I plunder you directly"
"If physical force can not be used we try to impose on each other by bluff and the more adroit overreaches the other"
"For the totality of the relationship it is a matter of chance who overreaches whom"
"On both sides therefore exchange is necessarily mediated by the object which each side produces and possesses"
"The ideal relationship to the respective objects of our production is of course our mutual need"
"But the real true relationship which actually occurs and takes effect is only the mutually exclusive possession of our respective products"
"What gives your need of my article its value worth and effect for me is solely your object the equivalent of my object"
"Our respective products therefore are the means the mediator the instrument the acknowledged power of our mutual needs"
"Your demand and the equivalent of your possession therefore are for me terms that are equal in significance and validity and your demand only acquires a meaning owing to having an effect when it has meaning and effect in relation to me"
"As a mere human being without this instrument your demand is an unsatisfied aspiration on your part and an idea that does not exist for me"
"As a human being therefore you stand in no relationship to my object because I myself have no human relationship to it"
"But the means is the true power over an object and therefore we mutually regard our products as the power of each of us over the other and over himself"
"That is to say our own product has risen up against us it seemed to be our property but in fact we are its property"
"We ourselves are excluded from true property because our property excludes other men"
"The only intelligible language in which we converse with one another consists of our objects in their relation to each other"
"We would not understand a human language and it would remain without effect"
"By one side it would be recognised and felt as being a request an entreaty and therefore a humiliation and consequently uttered with a feeling of shame of degradation"
"By the other side it would be regarded as impudence or lunacy and rejected as such"
"We are to such an extent estranged from man 's essential nature that the direct language of this essential nature seems to us a violation of human dignity whereas the estranged language of material values seems to be the well justified assertion of human dignity that is self confident and conscious of itself"
"Although in your eyes your product is an instrument a means for taking possession of my product and thus for satisfying your need yet in my eyes it is the purpose of our exchange"
"For me you are rather the means and instrument for producing this object that is my aim just as conversely you stand in the same relationship to my object"
"But 1 each of us actually behaves in the way he is regarded by the other"
"In fact therefore you have become for yourself a means an instrument of your object of which your desire is the servant and you have performed menial services in order that the object shall never again do a favour to your desire"
"If then our mutual thraldom to the object at the beginning of the process is now seen to be in reality the relationship between master and slave that is merely the crude and frank expression of our essential relationship"
"Our mutual value is for us the value of our mutual objects"
"Hence for us man himself is mutually of no value"
"Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings"
"Each of us would have in two ways affirmed himself and the other person"
"In my production I would have objectified my individuality its specific character and therefore enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity but also when looking at the object I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective visible to the senses and hence a power beyond all doubt"
"In your enjoyment or use of my product I would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work that is of having objectified man 's essential nature and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature"
"3 I would have been for you the mediator between you and the species and therefore would become recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion of your own essential nature and as a necessary part of yourself and consequently would know myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love"
"In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly confirmed and realised my true nature my human nature my communal nature"
"Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature"
"This relationship would moreover be reciprocal what occurs on my side has also to occur on yours"
"Let us review the various factors as seen in our supposition My work would be a free manifestation of life hence an enjoyment of life"
"Presupposing private property my work is an alienation of life for I work in order to live in order to obtain for myself the means of life"
"Secondly the specific nature of my individuality therefore would be affirmed in my labour since the latter would be an affirmation of my individual life"
"Labour therefore would be true active property"
"Presupposing private property my individuality is alienated to such a degree that this activity is instead hateful to me a torment and rather the semblance of an activity"
"Hence too it is only a forced activity and one imposed on me only through an external fortuitous need not through an inner essential one"
"My labour can appear in my object only as what it is"
"It can not appear as something which by its nature it is not"
"Hence it appears only as the expression of my loss of self and of my powerlessness that is objective sensuously perceptible obvious and therefore put beyond all doubt.[4 NOTES 1"
"Translated as Monetary System This was a specific belief among early Mercantilists"
"They contended that wealth consisted in money itself in building bullion reserves"
"It 's because of this that the export of gold or silver was not allowed forcing active trade balances between nations"
"This passage reads in the original German Durch die wechselseitige"
"Entfremdung des Privateigentums ist das Privateignetum selbst in die Bestimmung des entäusserten Privateigentums geraten"
"It demonstrates that when using the terms Entäusserung and Entfremdung to denote alienation Marx imparted to them an identical or nearly identical meaning"
"In all translations from early Marx the Collected Works translates Entäusserung as alienation and Entfremdung as estrangement"
"They made this decision based on the fact that Marx would later Theories of Surplus Value directly employ the word alienation as the English equivalent of Entäusserung"
"This refers primarily to James Mill who divided his system of political economy into four independent sections Production Distribution Exchange and Consumption"
"After the excerpts dealing with the question of land rent capital profit and wages as sources of taxation and state revenues Marx wrote Needless to say Mill like Ricardo denies that he wishes to impress on any government the idea that land rent should be made the sole source of taxes since this would be a partisan measure placing an unfair burden on a particular class of individuals"
"But and this is a momentous insidious but"
"Indeed the one doubt raised by political economy is rather an attraction than a cause for apprehension namely that even in a country with an ordinary number of population and or ordinary size the amount yielded by land rent would exceed the needs of the government"

"In all translations from early Marx the Collected Works translates Entäusserung as alienation and Entfremdung as estrangement"
"They made this decision based on the fact that Marx would later Theories of Surplus Value directly employ the word alienation as the English equivalent of Entäusserung"
"This refers primarily to James Mill who divided his system of political economy into four independent sections Production Distribution Exchange and Consumption"
"The rest of the conspectus contains further excerpts from Mill 's book"
"After the excerpts dealing with the question of land rent capital profit and wages as sources of taxation and state revenues Marx wrote"
"Needless to say Mill like Ricardo denies that he wishes to impress on any government the idea that land rent should be made the sole source of taxes since this would be a partisan measure placing an unfair burden on a particular class of individuals"
"But and this is a momentous insidious but"
"but the tax on land rent is the only tax that is not harmful from the standpoint of political economy hence the only just tax from the point of view of political economy"
"Indeed the one doubt raised by political economy is rather an attraction than a cause for apprehension namely that even in a country with an ordinary number of population and or ordinary size the amount yielded by land rent would exceed the needs of the government"

"Wages of Labour First Section 1844 Index | Study Guide | Marx Engels Internet Archive"
"Wages are determined through the antagonistic struggle between capitalist and worker"
"Victory goes necessarily to the capitalist"
"The capitalist can live longer without the worker than can the worker without the capitalist"
"Combination among the capitalists is customary and effective workers combination is prohibited and painful in its consequences for them"
"Besides the landowner and the capitalist can make use of industrial advantages to augment their revenues the worker has neither rent nor interest on capital to supplement his industrial income"
"Hence the intensity of the competition among the workers"
"Thus only for the workers is the separation of capital landed property and labour an inevitable essential and detrimental separation"
"Capital and landed property need not remain fixed in this abstraction as must the labour of the workers"
"The separation of capital rent and labour is thus fatal for the worker"
"The lowest and the only necessary wage rate is that providing for the subsistence of the worker for the duration of his work and as much more as is necessary for him to support a family and for the race of labourers not to die out"
"The ordinary wage according to Smith is the lowest compatible with common humanity 6 that is with cattle like existence"
"The demand for men necessarily governs the production of men as of every other commodity"
"The worker ’s existence is thus brought under the same condition as the existence of every other commodity"
"The worker has become a commodity and it is a bit of luck for him if he can find a buyer"
"Should supply exceed demand then one of the constituent parts of the price profit rent or wages is paid below its rate"
"a part of these factors is therefore withdrawn from this application and thus the market price gravitates towards the natural price as the centre point"
"Thus in the gravitation of market price to natural price it is the worker who loses most of all and necessarily"
"And it is just the capacity of the capitalist to direct his capital into another channel which either renders the worker who is restricted to some particular branch of labour destitute or forces him to submit to every demand of this capitalist"
"The accidental and sudden fluctuations in market price hit rent less than they do that part of the price which is resolved into profit and wages but they hit profit less than they do wages"
"In most cases for every wage that rises one remains stationary and one falls"
"The worker need not necessarily gain when the capitalist does but he necessarily loses when the latter loses"
"Thus the worker does not gain if the capitalist keeps the market price above the natural price by virtue of some manufacturing or trading secret or by virtue of monopoly or the favorable situation of his land"
"Furthermore the prices of labour are much more constant than the prices of provisions"
"In a dear year wages fall on account of the decrease in demand but rise on account of the increase in the prices of provisions and thus balance"
"In any case a number of workers are left without bread"
"In cheap years wages rise on account of the rise in demand but decrease on account of the fall in the prices of provisions and thus balance"
"Another respect in which the worker is at a disadvantage"
"The labour prices of the various kinds of workers show much wider differences than the profits in the various branches in which capital is applied"
"In labour all the natural spiritual and social variety of individual activity is manifested and is variously rewarded whilst dead capital always keeps the same pace and is indifferent to real individual activity"
"In general we should observe that in those cases where worker and capitalist equally suffer the worker suffers in his very existence the capitalist in the profit on his dead mammon"
"The worker has to struggle not only for his physical means of subsistence he has to struggle to get work i.e. the possibility the means to perform his activity"
"Let us take the three chief conditions in which society can find itself and consider the situation of the worker in them"
"1 If the wealth of society declines the worker suffers most of all and for the following reason although the working class can not gain so much as can the class of property owners in a prosperous state of society no one suffers so cruelly from its decline as the working class"
"2 Let us now take a society in which wealth is increasing"
"This condition is the only one favorable to the worker"
"Here competition between the capitalists sets in"
"The demand for workers exceeds their supply"
"The more they wish to earn the more must they sacrifice their time and carry out slave labour completely losing all their freedom in the service of greed"
"Thereby they shorten their lives"
"This shortening of their life span is a favourable circumstance for the working class as a whole for as a result of it an ever fresh supply of labour becomes necessary"
"This class has always to sacrifice a part of itself in order not to be wholly destroyed"
"Furthermore When does a society find itself in a condition of advancing wealth"
"But this is only possible"
"As the result of the accumulation of much labour capital being accumulated labour as the result therefore of the fact that more and more of his products are being taken away from the worker that to an increasing extent his own labour confronts him as another man ’s property and that the means of his existence and his activity are increasingly concentrated in the hands of the capitalist"
"The accumulation of capital increases the division of labour and the division of labour increases the number of workers"
"Conversely the number of workers increases the division of labour just as the division of labour increases the accumulation of capital"
"With this division of labour on the one hand and the accumulation of capital on the other the worker becomes ever more exclusively dependent on labour and on a particular very one sided machine like labour at that"
"Just as he is thus depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine and from being a man becomes an abstract activity and a belly so he also becomes ever more dependent on every fluctuation in market price on the application of capital and on the whim of the rich"
"Equally the increase in the class of people wholly dependent on work intensifies competition among the workers thus lowering their price"
"In the factory system this situation of the worker reaches its climax"
"In an increasingly prosperous society only the richest of the rich can continue to live on money interest"
"Everyone else has to carry on a business with his capital or venture it in trade"
"As a result the competition between the capitalists becomes more intense"
"The concentration of capital increases the big capitalists ruin the small and a section of the erstwhile capitalists sinks into the working class which as a result of this supply again suffers to some extent a depression of wages and passes into a still greater dependence on the few big capitalists"
"Consequently a section of the working class falls into beggary or starvation just as necessarily as a section of the middle capitalists falls into the working class"
"Hence even in the condition of society most favorable to the worker the inevitable result for the worker is overwork and premature death decline to a mere machine a bond servant of capital which piles up dangerously over and against him more competition and starvation or beggary for a section of the workers"
"The raising of wages excites in the worker the capitalist ’s mania to get rich which he however can only satisfy by the sacrifice of his mind and body"
"The raising of wages presupposes and entails the accumulation of capital and thus sets the product of labour against the worker as something ever more alien to him"
"Since the worker has sunk to the level of a machine he can be confronted by the machine as a competitor"
"Finally as the amassing of capital increases the amount of industry and therefore the number of workers it causes the same amount of industry to manufacture a larger amount of products which leads to over production and thus either ends by throwing a large section of workers out of work or by reducing their wages to the most miserable minimum"
"Such are the consequences of a state of society most favourable to the worker namely of a state of growing advancing wealth"
"Eventually however this state of growth must sooner or later reach its peak"
"What is the worker ’s position now"
"In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches"
"both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low"
"the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers and the country being already fully peopled that number could never be augmented"
"Adam Smith Wealth of Nations Vol"
"Thus in a declining state of society increasing misery of the worker in an advancing state misery with complications and in a fully developed state of society static misery"
"Since however according to Smith a society is not happy of which the greater part suffers yet even the wealthiest state of society leads to this suffering of the majority and since the economic system 7 and in general a society based on private interest leads to this wealthiest condition it follows that the goal of the economic system is the unhappiness of society"
"Concerning the relationship between worker and capitalist we should add that the capitalist is more than compensated for rising wages by the reduction in the amount of labour time and that rising wages and rising interest on capital operate on the price of commodities like simple and compound interest respectively"
"Let us put ourselves now wholly at the standpoint of the political economist and follow him in comparing the theoretical and practical claims of the workers"
"He tells us that originally and in theory the whole product of labour belongs to the worker"
"The political economist tells us that everything is bought with labour and that capital is nothing but accumulated labour but at the same time he tells us that the worker far from being able to buy everything must sell himself and his humanity"
"Whilst the rent of the idle landowner usually amounts to a third of the product of the soil and the profit of the busy capitalist to as much as twice the interest on money the something more which the worker himself earns at the best of times amounts to so little that of four children of his two must starve and die"
"Whilst according to the political economists it is solely through labour that man enhances the value of the products of nature whilst labour is man ’s active possession according to this same political economy the landowner and the capitalist who qua landowner and capitalist are merely privileged and idle gods are everywhere superior to the worker and lay down the law to him"
"Whilst according to the political economists labour is the sole unchanging price of things there is nothing more fortuitous than the price of labour nothing exposed to greater fluctuations"
"Whilst the division of labour raises the productive power of labour and increases the wealth and refinement of society it impoverishes the worker and reduces him to a machine"
"Whilst labour brings about the accumulation of capital and with this the increasing prosperity of society it renders the worker ever more dependent on the capitalist leads him into competition of a new intensity and drives him into the headlong rush of overproduction with its subsequent corresponding slump"
"Whilst the interest of the worker according to the political economists never stands opposed to the interest of society society always and necessarily stands opposed to the interest of the worker"
"According to the political economists the interest of the worker is never opposed to that of society"
"1 because the rising wages are more than compensated by the reduction in the amount of labour time together with the other consequences set forth above and 2 because in relation to society the whole gross product is the net product and only in relation to the private individual has the net product any significance"
"But that labour itself not merely in present conditions but insofar as its purpose in general is the mere increase of wealth that labour itself I say is harmful and pernicious follows from the political economist ’s line of argument without his being aware of it"
"In theory rent of land and profit on capital are deductions suffered by wages"
"When society is in a state of decline the worker suffers most severely"
"The specific severity of his burden he owes to his position as a worker but the burden as such to the position of society"
"Society in a state of maximum wealth an ideal but one which is approximately attained and which at least is the aim of political economy as of civil society means for the workers static misery"
"It goes without saying that the proletarian i.e. the man who being without capital and rent lives purely by labour and by a one sided abstract labour is considered by political economy only as a worker"
"Political economy can therefore advance the proposition that the proletarian the same as any horse must get as much as will enable him to work"
"It does not consider him when he is not working as a human being but leaves such consideration to criminal law to doctors to religion to the statistical tables to politics and to the poor house overseer"
"Let us now rise above the level of political economy and try to answer two questions on the basis of the above exposition which has been presented almost in the words of the political economists"
"What in the evolution of mankind is the meaning of this reduction of the greater part of mankind to abstract labour"
"2 What are the mistakes committed by the piecemeal reformers who either want to raise wages and in this way to improve the situation of the working class or regard equality of wages as Proudhon does as the goal of social revolution"
"||VIII 1|“It can be asserted that those occupations which presuppose specific talents or longer training have become on the whole more lucrative whilst the proportionate reward for mechanically monotonous activity in which one person can be trained as easily and quickly as another has fallen with growing competition and was inevitably bound to fall"
"And it is just this sort of work which in the present state of the organization of labour is still by far the commonest"
"If therefore a worker in the first category now earns seven times as much as he did say fifty years ago whilst the earnings of another in the second category have remained unchanged then of course both are earning on the average four times as much"
"But if the first category comprises only a thousand workers in a particular country and the second a million then 999,000 are no better off than fifty years ago and they are worse off if at the same time the prices of the necessaries of life have risen"
"With such superficial calculation of averages people try to deceive themselves about the most numerous class of the population"
"Moreover the size of the wage is only one factor in the estimation of the worker ’s income because it is essential for the measurement of the latter to take into account the certainty of its duration which is obviously out of the question in the anarchy of so called free competition with its ever recurring fluctuations and periods of stagnation"
"Finally the hours of work customary formerly and now have to be considered"
"And for the English cotton workers these have been increased as a result of the entrepreneurs mania for profit"
"||IX 1| to between twelve and sixteen hours a day during the past twenty five years or so that is to say precisely during the period of the introduction of labour saving machines and this increase in one country and in one branch of industry inevitably asserted itself elsewhere to a greater or lesser degree for the right of the unlimited exploitation of the poor by the rich is still universally recognized"
"Wilhelm Schulz Die Bewegung der Production"
"But even if it were as true as it is false that the average income of every class of society has increased the income differences and relative income distances may nevertheless have become greater and the contrasts between wealth and poverty accordingly stand out more sharply"
"For just because total production rises and in the same measure as it rises needs desires and claims also multiply and thus relative poverty can increase whilst absolute poverty diminishes"
"The Samoyed living on fish oil and rancid fish is not poor because in his secluded society all have the same needs"
"But in a state that is forging ahead which in the course of a decade say increased by a third its total production in proportion to the population the worker who is getting as much at the end of ten years as at the beginning has not remained as well off but has become poorer by a third"
"But political economy knows the worker only as a working animal as a beast reduced to the strictest bodily needs"
"To develop in greater spiritual freedom a people must break their bondage to their bodily needs they must cease to be the slaves of the body"
"They must above all have time at their disposal for spiritual creative activity and spiritual enjoyment"
"The developments in the labour organism gain this time"
"Indeed with new motive forces and improved machinery a single worker in the cotton mills now often performs the work formerly requiring a hundred or even 250 to 350 workers"
"Similar results can be observed in all branches of production because external natural forces are being compelled to participate to an ever greater degree in human labour"
"If the satisfaction of a given amount of material needs formerly required a certain expenditure of time and human effort which has later been reduced by half then without any loss of material comfort the scope for spiritual activity and enjoyment has been simultaneously extended by as much"
"But again the way in which the booty that we win from old Cronus Greek God associated with time"
"himself in his most private domain is shared out is still decided by the dice throw of blind unjust Chance"
"In France it has been calculated that at the present stage in the development of production an average working period of five hours a day by every person capable of work could suffice for the satisfaction of all the material interests of society"
"Notwithstanding the time saved by the perfecting of machinery"
"the duration of the slave labour performed by a large population in the factories has only increased"
"The transition from compound manual labour rests on a break down of the latter into its simple operations"
"At first however only some of the uniformly recurring operations will devolve on machines while some will devolve on men"
"From the nature of things and from confirmatory experience it is clear that unendingly monotonous activity of this kind is as harmful to the mind as to the body thus this combination of machinery with mere division of labour among a greater number of hands must inevitably show all the disadvantages of the latter"
"These disadvantages appear among other things in the greater mortality of factory workers"
"Consideration has not been given to this big distinction as to how far men work through machines or how far as machines"
"In the future life of the peoples however the inanimate forces of nature working in machines will be our slaves and serfs"
"The English spinning mills employ 196,818 women and only 158,818 men"
"For every 100 male workers in the cotton mills of Lancashire there are 103 female workers and in Scotland as many as 209"
"In the English flax mills of Leeds for every 100 male workers there were found to be 147 female workers"
"In Dundee and on the east coast of Scotland as many as 280"
"In the English silk mills many female workers male workers predominate in the woollen mills where the work requires greater physical strength"
"In 1833 no fewer than 38,927 women were employed alongside 18,593 men in the North American cotton mills"
"As a result of the changes in the labour organism a wider sphere of gainful employment has thus fallen to the share of the female sex"
"Women now occupying an economically more independent position"
"the two sexes are drawn closer together in their social conditions"
"Working in the English steam- and water driven spinning mills in 1835 were 20,558 children between the ages of eight and twelve 35,867 between the ages of twelve and thirteen and lastly 108,208 children between the ages of thirteen and eighteen"
"But standing in the way of these more rapid advances is the very circumstance that the capitalists can in the easiest and cheapest fashion appropriate the energies of the lower classes down to the children to be used instead of mechanical devices"
"Lord Brougham ’s call to the workers Become capitalists"
"This is the evil that millions are able to earn a bare subsistence for themselves only by strenuous labour which shatters the body and cripples them morally and intellectually that they are even obliged to consider the misfortune of finding such work a piece of good fortune"

"The average life of these unfortunate creatures on the streets after they have embarked on their career of vice is about six or seven years"
"To maintain the number of sixty to seventy thousand prostitutes there must be in the three kingdoms at least eight to nine thousand women who commit themselves to this abject profession each year or about twenty four new victims each day an average of one per hour and it follows that if the same proportion holds good over the whole surface of the globe there must constantly be in existence one and a half million unfortunate women of this kind"

"Up to the present industry has been in a state of war a war of conquest"
"It has squandered the lives of the men who made up its army with the same indifference as the great conquerors"
"Its aim was the possession of wealth not the happiness of men"
"These interests that is economic interests freely left to themselves must necessarily come into conflict they have no other arbiter but war and the decisions of war assign defeat and death to some in order to give victory to the others"
"It is in the conflict of opposed forces that science seeks order and equilibrium perpetual war according to it is the sole means of obtaining peace that war is called competition"
"The industrial war to be conducted with success demands large armies which it can amass on one spot and profusely decimate"
"And it is neither from devotion nor from duty that the soldiers of this army bear the exertions imposed on them but only to escape the hard necessity of hunger"
"They feel neither attachment nor gratitude towards their bosses nor are these bound to their subordinates by any feeling of benevolence"
"They do not know them as men but only as instruments of production which have to yield as much as possible with as little cost as possible"
"These populations of workers ever more crowded together have not even the assurance of always being employed"
"Industry which has called them together only lets them live while it needs them and as soon as it can get rid of them it abandons them without the slightest scruple and the workers are compelled to offer their persons and their powers for whatever price they can get"
"The longer more painful and more disgusting the work they are given the less they are paid"
"There are those who with sixteen hours work a day and unremitting exertion scarcely buy the right not to die"

"Preface and Table of Contents | Profit of Capital"
"Karl Marx Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844"
"What is the basis of capital that is of private property in the products of other men 's labour"
"Even if capital itself does not merely amount to theft or fraud it still requires the cooperation of legislation to sanctify inheritance"
"How does one become a proprietor of productive stock"
"How does one become owner of the products created by means of this stock"
"By virtue of positive law"
"What does one acquire with capital with the inheritance of a large fortune for instance"
"The person who either acquires or succeeds to a great fortune does not necessarily acquire or succeed to any political power"
"The power which that possession immediately and directly conveys to him is the power of purchasing a certain command over all the labour or over all the produce of labour which is then in the market"
"Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith Vol"
"Capital is thus the governing power over labour and its products"
"The capitalist possesses this power not on account of his personal or human qualities but inasmuch as he is an owner of capital"
"His power is the purchasing power of his capital which nothing can withstand"
"Later we shall see first how the capitalist by means of capital exercises his governing power over labour then however we shall see the governing power of capital over the capitalist himself"
"A certain quantity of labour stocked and stored up to be employed"
"2 Fonds or stock is any accumulation of products of the soil or of manufacture"
"The profit or gain of capital is altogether different from the wages of labour"
"This difference is manifested in two ways in the first place the profits of capital are regulated altogether by the value of the capital employed although the labour of inspection and direction associated with different capitals may be the same"
"Moreover in large works the whole of this labour is committed to some principal clerk whose salary bears no regular proportion to the ||II 2| capital of which he oversees the management"
"And although the labour of the proprietor is here reduced almost to nothing he still demands profits in proportion to his capital"
"Why does the capitalist demand this proportion between profit and capital"
"The capitalist thus makes a profit first on the wages and secondly on the raw materials advanced by him"
"What proportion then does profit bear to capital"
"If it is already difficult to determine the usual average level of wages at a particular place and at a particular time it is even more difficult to determine the profit on capitals"
"A change in the price of the commodities in which the capitalist deals the good or bad fortune of his rivals and customers a thousand other accidents to which commodities are exposed both in transit and in the warehouses all produce a daily almost hourly variation in profit"
"But though it is impossible to determine with precision what are the profits on capitals some notion may be formed of them from the interest of money"
"Wherever a great deal can be made by the use of money a great deal will be given for the use of it wherever little can be made by it little will be given"
"The proportion which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to the rate of clear profit necessarily varies as profit rises or falls"
"Double interest is in Great Britain reckoned what the merchants call a good moderate reasonable profit terms which mean no more than a common and usual profit"
"What is the lowest rate of profit"
"And what the highest"
"The lowest rate of ordinary profit on capital must always be something more than what is sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to which every employment of stock is exposed"
"The same holds for the lowest rate of interest"
"||III 2| The highest rate to which ordinary profits can rise is that which in the price of the greater part of commodities eats up the whole of the rent of the land and reduces the wages of labour contained in the commodity supplied to the lowest rate the bare subsistence of the labourer during his work"
"For example the servants of the East India Company in Bengal"
"I pp 86 87"
"Besides all the advantages of limited competition which the capitalist may exploit in this case he can keep the market price above the natural price by quite decorous means"
"For one thing by keeping secrets in trade if the market is at a great distance from those who supply it that is by concealing a price change its rise above the natural level"
"This concealment has the effect that other capitalists do not follow him in investing their capital in this branch of industry or trade"
"Then again by keeping secrets in manufacture which enable the capitalist to reduce the costs of production and supply his commodity at the same or even at lower prices than his competitors while obtaining a higher profit"
"Deceiving by keeping secrets is not immoral"
"Dealings on the Stock Exchange"
"Furthermore where production is restricted to a particular locality as in the case of a rare wine and where the effective demand can never be satisfied"
"Finally through monopolies exercised by individuals or companies"
"Monopoly price is the highest possible"
"The acquisition of new territories or of new branches of trade often increases the profit on capital even in a wealthy country because they withdraw some capital from the old branches of trade reduce competition and cause the market to be supplied with fewer commodities the prices of which then rise"
"those who deal in these commodities can then afford to borrow at a higher rate of interest"
"The more a commodity comes to be manufactured the more it becomes an object of manufacture the greater becomes that part of the price which resolves itself into wages and profit in proportion to that which resolves itself into rent"
"In the progress of the manufacture of a commodity not only the number of profits increases but every subsequent profit is greater than the foregoing because the capital from which ||IV 2| it is derived must always be greater"
"The capital which employs the weavers for example must always be greater than that which employs the spinners because it not only replaces that capital with its profits but pays besides the wages of weavers and the profits must always bear some proportion to the capital"
"Thus the advance made by human labour in converting the product of nature into the manufactured product of nature increases not the wages of labour but in part the number of profitable capital investments and in part the size of every subsequent capital in comparison with the foregoing"
"More about the advantages which the capitalist derives from the division of labour later"
"He profits doubly first by the division of labour and secondly in general by the advance which human labour makes on the natural product"
"The greater the human share in a commodity the greater the profit of dead capital"
"In one and the same society the average rates of profit on capital are much more nearly on the same level than the wages of the different sorts of labour"
"In the different employments of capital the ordinary rate of profit varies with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns"
"The ordinary profit of stock though it rises with the risk does not always seem to rise in proportion to it"
"It goes without saying that profits also rise if the means of circulation become less expensive or easier available e.g. paper money"
"The Rule of Capital over Labour and the Motives of the Capitalist"
"The consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture in manufactures or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail trade"
"The different quantities of productive labour which it may put into motion ||V 2| and the different values which it may add to the annual produce of the land and labour of his country according as it is employed in one or other of those different ways never enter into his thoughts"
"The most useful employment of capital for the capitalist is that which risks being equal yields him the greatest profit"
"This employment is not always the most useful for society the most useful employment is that which utilises the productive powers of nature"
"Say t. II pp 130 31"
"The plans and speculations of the employers of capitals regulate and direct all the most important operations of labour and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects"
"But the rate of profit does not like rent and wages rise with the prosperity and fall with the decline of the society"
"On the contrary it is naturally low in rich and high in poor countries and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin"
"The interest of this class therefore has not the same connection with the general interest of the society as that of the other two"
"The particular interest of the dealers in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and frequently even in sharp opposition to that of the public"
"To widen the market and to narrow the sellers competition is always the interest of the dealer"
"This is a class of people whose interest is never exactly the same as that of society a class of people who have generally an interest to deceive and to oppress the public"
"The Accumulation of Capitals and the Competition among the Capitalists"
"The increase of stock which raises wages tends to lower the capitalists profit because of the competition amongst the capitalists"
"If for example the capital which is necessary for the grocery trade of a particular town is divided between two different grocers their competition will tend to make both of them sell cheaper than if it were in the hands of one only and if it were divided among twenty ||VI 2| their competition would be just so much the greater and the chance of their combining together in order to raise the price just so much the less"
"I pp 87 88 it follows that the sole defence against the capitalists is competition which according to the evidence of political economy acts beneficently by both raising wages and lowering the prices of commodities to the advantage of the consuming public"
"But competition is only possible if capital multiplies and is held in many hands"
"The formation of many capital investments is only possible as a result of multilateral accumulation since capital comes into being only by accumulation and multilateral accumulation necessarily turns into unilateral accumulation"
"Competition among capitalists increases the accumulation of capital"
"Accumulation where private property prevails is the concentration of capital in the hands of a few it is in general an inevitable consequence if capital is left to follow its natural course and it is precisely through competition that the way is cleared for this natural disposition of capital"
"We have been told that the profit on capital is in proportion to the size of the capital"
"A large capital therefore accumulates more quickly than a small capital in proportion to its size even if we disregard for the time being deliberate"
"Accordingly the accumulation of large capital proceeds much more rapidly than that of smaller capital quite irrespective of competition"
"But let us follow this process further"
"With the increase of capital the profit on capital diminishes because of competition"
"The increase of capitals and a large number of capital investments presuppose further a condition of advancing wealth in the country"
"In a country which had acquired its full complement of riches"
"middling fortunes would be obliged to superintend themselves the employment of their own stocks"
"It would be necessary that almost every man should be a man of business or engage in some sort of trade"
"This is the situation most dear to the heart of political economy"
"The proportion between capital and revenue therefore seems everywhere to regulate the proportion between industry and idleness wherever capital predominates industry prevails wherever revenue idleness"
"What about the employment of capital then in this condition of increased competition"
"As stock increases the quantity of stock to be lent at interest grows gradually greater and greater"
"As the quantity of stock to be lent at interest increases the interest diminishes i because the market price of things commonly diminishes as their quantity increases"
"because with the increase of capitals in any country it becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the country a profitable method of employing any new capital"
"There arises in consequence a competition between different capitals the owner of one endeavouring to get possession of that employment which is occupied by another"
"But upon most occasions he can hope to jostle that other out of this employment by no other means but by dealing upon more reasonable terms"
"He must not only sell what he deals in somewhat cheaper but in order to get it to sell he must sometimes too buy it dearer"
"The demand for productive labour by the increase of the funds which are destined for maintaining it grows every day greater and greater"
"Labourers easily find employment |IX 2| but the owners of capitals find it difficult to get labourers to employ"
"Their competition raises the wages of labour and sinks the profits of stock"
"Thus the small capitalist has the choice 1 either to consume his capital since he can no longer live on the interest and thus cease to be a capitalist or 2 to set up a business himself sell his commodity cheaper buy dearer than the wealthier capitalist and pay higher wages thus ruining himself the market price being already very low as a result of the intense competition presupposed"
"The larger size of his capital compensates him for the smaller profits and he can even bear temporary losses until the smaller capitalist is ruined and he finds himself freed from this competition"
"In this way he accumulates the small capitalist 's profits"
"Furthermore the big capitalist always buys cheaper than the small one because he buys bigger quantities"
"He can therefore well afford to sell cheaper"
"But if a fall in the rate of interest turns the middle capitalists from rentiers into businessmen the increase in business capital and the resulting smaller profit produce conversely a fall in the rate of interest"
"When the profits which can be made by the use of a capital are diminished the price which can be paid for the use of it must necessarily be diminished with them"
"As riches improvement and population have increased interest has declined and consequently the profits of capitalists after these profits are diminished stock may not only continue to increase but to increase much faster than before"
"A great stock though with small profits generally increases faster than a small stock with great profits"
"Money says the proverb makes money"
"When therefore this large capital is opposed by small capitals with small profits as it is under the presupposed condition of intense competition it crushes them completely"
"The necessary result of this competition is a general deterioration of commodities adulteration fake production and universal poisoning evident in large towns"
"The capital employed in this manner yields no revenue or profit to its employer while it either remains in his possession or continues in the same shape"
"His capital is continually going from him in one shape and returning to him in another and it is only by means of such circulation or successive exchanges and transformations that it can yield him any profit"
"Fixed capital consists of capital invested in the improvement of land in the purchase of useful machines and instruments of trade or in such like things"
"Every saving in the expense of supporting the fixed capital is an improvement of the net revenue of the society"
"The whole capital of the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided between his fixed and his circulating capital"
"While his whole capital remains the same the smaller the one part the greater must necessarily be the other"
"which furnishes the materials and wages of labour and puts industry into motion"
"Every saving therefore in the expense of maintaining the fixed capital which does not diminish the productive powers of labour must increase the fund which puts industry into motion"
"It is clear from the outset that the relation of fixed capital and circulating capital is much more favourable to the big capitalist than to the smaller capitalist"
"The extra fixed capital required by a very big banker as against a very small one is insignificant"
"Their fixed capital amounts to nothing more than the office"
"The equipment of the bigger landowner does not increase in proportion to the size of his estate"
"Finally it is obvious that where industrial labour has reached a high level and where therefore almost all manual labour has become factory labour the entire capital of a small capitalist does not suffice to provide him even with the necessary fixed capital"
"Note by Marx in French"
"The big capitalist introduces for himself some kind of organisation of the instruments of labour.||XI 2|"
"Similarly in the sphere of industry every manufactory and mill is already a comprehensive combination of a large material fortune with numerous and varied intellectual capacities and technical skills serving the common purpose of production"
"Where legislation preserves landed property in large units the surplus of a growing population flocks into trades and it is therefore as in Great Britain in the field of industry principally that proletarians aggregate in great numbers"
"Where however the law permits the continuous division of the land the number of small"
"debt encumbered proprietors increases as in France and the continuing process of fragmentation throws them into the class of the needy and the discontented"
"When eventually this fragmentation and indebtedness reaches a higher degree still big landed property once more swallows up small property just as large scale industry destroys small industry"
"And as larger estates are formed again large numbers of propertyless workers not required for the cultivation of the soil are again driven into industry"
"Schulz Bewegung der Production pp 58 59"
"Commodities of the same kind change in character as a result of changes in the method of production and especially as a result of the use of machinery"
"On the average the prices of cotton goods have decreased in England during the past 45 years by eleven twelfths and according to Marshall 's calculations the same amount of manufactured goods for which 16 shillings was still paid in 1814 is now supplied at 1 shilling and 10 pence"
"The greater cheapness of industrial products expands both consumption at home and the market abroad and because of this the number of workers in cotton has not only not fallen in Great Britain after the introduction of machines but has risen from forty thousand to one and a half million"
"As to the earnings of industrial entrepreneurs and workers the growing competition between the factory owners has resulted in their profits necessarily falling relative to the amount of products supplied by them"
"In the years 1820 33 the Manchester manufacturer 's gross profit on a piece of calico fell from four shillings 1 1/3 pence to one shilling 9 pence"
"But to make up for this loss the volume of manufacture has been correspondingly increased"
"The consequence of this is that separate branches of industry experience over production to some extent that frequent bankruptcies occur causing property to fluctuate and vacillate unstably within the class of capitalists and masters of labour thus throwing into the proletariat some of those who have been ruined economically and that frequently and suddenly close downs or cuts in employment become necessary the painful effects of which are always bitterly felt by the class of wage labourers"
"To hire out the materials of labour is to establish one 's freedom"
"Labour is man the materials on the other hand contain nothing human"
"Pecqueur Th � orie sociale etc"
"The material element which is quite incapable of creating wealth without the other element"
"labour acquires the magical virtue of being fertile for them who own this material element as if by their own action they had placed there this indispensable element"
"Supposing that the daily labour of a worker brings him on the average 400 francs a year and that this sum suffices for every adult to live some sort of crude life then any proprietor receiving 2,000 francs in interest or rent from a farm a house etc compels indirectly five men to work for him an income of 100,000 francs represents the labour of 250 men and that of 1,000,000 francs the labour of 2,500 individuals hence 300 million Louis Philippe"
"therefore the labour of 750,000 workers"
"The human law has given owners the right to use and to abuse that is to say the right to do what they will with the materials of labour"
"They are in no way obliged by law to provide work for the propertyless when required and at all times or to pay them always an adequate wage etc"
"Complete freedom concerning the nature the quantity the quality and the expediency of production concerning the use and the disposal of wealth and full command over the materials of all labour"
"Everyone is free to exchange what belongs to him as he thinks fit without considering anything other than his own interest as an individual op"
"Competition is merely the expression of the freedom to exchange which itself is the immediate and logical consequence of the individual ’s right to use and abuse all the instruments of production"
"The right to use and abuse freedom of exchange and arbitrary competition these three economic moments which form one unit entail the following consequences each produces what he wishes as he wishes when he wishes where he wishes produces well or produces badly produces too much or not enough too soon or too late at too high a price or too low a price none knows whether he will sell to whom he will sell how he will sell when he will sell where he will sell"
"And it is the same with regard to purchases"
"||XIII 2| The producer is ignorant of needs and resources of demand and supply"
"He sells when he wishes when he can where he wishes to whom he wishes at the price he wishes"
"And he buys in the same way"

"Whilst at one place there is scarcity at another there is glut and waste"

"I pp 306 07"
"As the accumulation of stock must in the nature of things be previous to the division of labour so labour can be more and more subdivided in proportion only as stock is previously more and more accumulated"
"The quantity of materials which the same number of people can work up increases in a great proportion as labour comes to be more and more subdivided and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to a greater degree of simplicity a variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitating and abridging those operations"
"As the division of labour advances therefore in order to give constant employment to an equal number of workmen an equal stock of provisions and a greater stock of materials and tools than what would have been necessary in a ruder state of things must be accumulated beforehand"
"But the number of workmen in every branch of business generally increases with the division of labour in that branch or rather it is the increase of their number which enables them to class and subdivide themselves in this manner"
"As the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on this great improvement in the productive powers of labour so that accumulation naturally leads to this improvement"
"The person who employs his stock in maintaining labour necessarily wishes to employ it in such a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as possible"
"He endeavours therefore both to make among his workmen the most proper distribution of employment and to furnish them with the best machines which he can either invent or afford to purchase"
"His abilities in both these respects |XV 2| are generally in proportion to the extent of his stock or to the number of people whom it can employ"

"Already here and there closer association of the chief branches of production"
"Thus big manufacturers will try to acquire also large estates in order to become independent of others for at least a part of the raw materials required for their industry or they will go into trade in conjunction with their industrial enterprises not only to sell their own manufactures but also to purchase other kinds of products and to sell these to their workers"
"In England where a single factory owner sometimes employs ten to twelve thousand workers it is already not uncommon to find such combinations of various branches of production controlled by one brain such smaller states or provinces within the state"

"The capitalists are thereby enabled to apply their savings in more diverse ways and perhaps even to employ them simultaneously in agriculture industry and commerce"
"As a consequence their interest becomes more comprehensive ||XVI 2| and the contradictions between agricultural industrial and commercial interests are reduced and disappear"

"Labourers easily find employment |IX 2| but the owners of capitals find it difficult to get labourers to employ"
"Their competition raises the wages of labour and sinks the profits of stock"
"Thus the small capitalist has the choice 1 either to consume his capital since he can no longer live on the interest and thus cease to be a capitalist or 2 to set up a business himself sell his commodity cheaper buy dearer than the wealthier capitalist and pay higher wages thus ruining himself the market price being already very low as a result of the intense competition presupposed"
"If however the big capitalist wants to squeeze out the smaller capitalist he has all the advantages over him which the capitalist has as a capitalist over the worker"
"The larger size of his capital compensates him for the smaller profits and he can even bear temporary losses until the smaller capitalist is ruined and he finds himself freed from this competition"
"In this way he accumulates the small capitalist 's profits"
"Furthermore the big capitalist always buys cheaper than the small one because he buys bigger quantities"
"He can therefore well afford to sell cheaper"
"But if a fall in the rate of interest turns the middle capitalists from rentiers into businessmen the increase in business capital and the resulting smaller profit produce conversely a fall in the rate of interest"
"When the profits which can be made by the use of a capital are diminished the price which can be paid for the use of it must necessarily be diminished with them"
"As riches improvement and population have increased interest has declined and consequently the profits of capitalists after these profits are diminished stock may not only continue to increase but to increase much faster than before"
"Money says the proverb makes money"
"When therefore this large capital is opposed by small capitals with small profits as it is under the presupposed condition of intense competition it crushes them completely"
"The necessary result of this competition is a general deterioration of commodities adulteration fake production and universal poisoning evident in large towns"
"||X 2| An important circumstance in the competition of large and small capital is furthermore the relation between fixed capital and circulating capital"
"Circulating capital is a capital which is employed in raising provisions manufacturing or purchasing goods and selling them again"
"The capital employed in this manner yields no revenue or profit to its employer while it either remains in his possession or continues in the same shape"
"His capital is continually going from him in one shape and returning to him in another and it is only by means of such circulation or successive exchanges and transformations that it can yield him any profit"
"Fixed capital consists of capital invested in the improvement of land in the purchase of useful machines and instruments of trade or in such like things"
"Every saving in the expense of supporting the fixed capital is an improvement of the net revenue of the society"
"The whole capital of the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided between his fixed and his circulating capital"
"While his whole capital remains the same the smaller the one part the greater must necessarily be the other"
"It is the circulating capital Marx uses the French terms capital fix � and capital circulant"
"which furnishes the materials and wages of labour and puts industry into motion"
"Every saving therefore in the expense of maintaining the fixed capital which does not diminish the productive powers of labour must increase the fund which puts industry into motion"
"Their fixed capital amounts to nothing more than the office"
"The equipment of the bigger landowner does not increase in proportion to the size of his estate"
"Similarly the credit which a big capitalist enjoys compared with a smaller one means for him all the greater saving in fixed capital that is in the amount of ready money he must always have at hand"
"Finally it is obvious that where industrial labour has reached a high level and where therefore almost all manual labour has become factory labour the entire capital of a small capitalist does not suffice to provide him even with the necessary fixed capital"
"As is well known large scale cultivation usually provides employment only for a small number of hands"
"Note by Marx in French"
"It is generally true that the accumulation of large capital is also accompanied by a proportional concentration and simplification of fixed capital as compared to the smaller capitalists"
"Similarly in the sphere of industry every manufactory and mill is already a comprehensive combination of a large material fortune with numerous and varied intellectual capacities and technical skills serving the common purpose of production"
"Where legislation preserves landed property in large units the surplus of a growing population flocks into trades and it is therefore as in Great Britain in the field of industry principally that proletarians aggregate in great numbers"
"Where however the law permits the continuous division of the land the number of small"
"debt encumbered proprietors increases as in France and the continuing process of fragmentation throws them into the class of the needy and the discontented"
"When eventually this fragmentation and indebtedness reaches a higher degree still big landed property once more swallows up small property just as large scale industry destroys small industry"
"And as larger estates are formed again large numbers of propertyless workers not required for the cultivation of the soil are again driven into industry"
"Schulz Bewegung der Production pp 58 59"
"Commodities of the same kind change in character as a result of changes in the method of production and especially as a result of the use of machinery"
"On the average the prices of cotton goods have decreased in England during the past 45 years by eleven twelfths and according to Marshall 's calculations the same amount of manufactured goods for which 16 shillings was still paid in 1814 is now supplied at 1 shilling and 10 pence"
"The greater cheapness of industrial products expands both consumption at home and the market abroad and because of this the number of workers in cotton has not only not fallen in Great Britain after the introduction of machines but has risen from forty thousand to one and a half million"
"As to the earnings of industrial entrepreneurs and workers the growing competition between the factory owners has resulted in their profits necessarily falling relative to the amount of products supplied by them"
"In the years 1820 33 the Manchester manufacturer 's gross profit on a piece of calico fell from four shillings 1 1/3 pence to one shilling 9 pence"
"But to make up for this loss the volume of manufacture has been correspondingly increased"
"The consequence of this is that separate branches of industry experience over production to some extent that frequent bankruptcies occur causing property to fluctuate and vacillate unstably within the class of capitalists and masters of labour thus throwing into the proletariat some of those who have been ruined economically and that frequently and suddenly close downs or cuts in employment become necessary the painful effects of which are always bitterly felt by the class of wage labourers"
"To hire out one 's labour is to begin one 's enslavement"
"To hire out the materials of labour is to establish one 's freedom"
"Labour is man the materials on the other hand contain nothing human"
"Pecqueur Th � orie sociale etc"
"The material element which is quite incapable of creating wealth without the other element"
"labour acquires the magical virtue of being fertile for them who own this material element as if by their own action they had placed there this indispensable element"
"Supposing that the daily labour of a worker brings him on the average 400 francs a year and that this sum suffices for every adult to live some sort of crude life then any proprietor receiving 2,000 francs in interest or rent from a farm a house etc compels indirectly five men to work for him an income of 100,000 francs represents the labour of 250 men and that of 1,000,000 francs the labour of 2,500 individuals hence 300 million Louis Philippe"
"therefore the labour of 750,000 workers"
"The human law has given owners the right to use and to abuse that is to say the right to do what they will with the materials of labour"
"They are in no way obliged by law to provide work for the propertyless when required and at all times or to pay them always an adequate wage etc"
"Complete freedom concerning the nature the quantity the quality and the expediency of production concerning the use and the disposal of wealth and full command over the materials of all labour"
"Everyone is free to exchange what belongs to him as he thinks fit without considering anything other than his own interest as an individual op"
"Competition is merely the expression of the freedom to exchange which itself is the immediate and logical consequence of the individual ’s right to use and abuse all the instruments of production"
"The right to use and abuse freedom of exchange and arbitrary competition these three economic moments which form one unit entail the following consequences each produces what he wishes as he wishes when he wishes where he wishes produces well or produces badly produces too much or not enough too soon or too late at too high a price or too low a price none knows whether he will sell to whom he will sell how he will sell when he will sell where he will sell"
"And it is the same with regard to purchases"
"He sells when he wishes when he can where he wishes to whom he wishes at the price he wishes"
"And he buys in the same way"
"In all this he is ever the plaything of chance the slave of the law of the strongest of the least harassed of the richest"
"Whilst at one place there is scarcity at another there is glut and waste"
"Whilst one producer sells a lot or at a very high price and at an enormous profit the other sells nothing or sells at a loss"
"The supply does not know the demand and the demand does not know the supply"
"You produce trusting to a taste a fashion which prevails amongst the consuming public"
"But by the time you are ready to deliver the commodity the whim has already passed and has settled on some other kind of product"
"The inevitable consequences bankruptcies occurring constantly and universally miscalculations sudden ruin and unexpected fortunes commercial crises stoppages periodic gluts or shortages instability and depreciation of wages and profits the loss or enormous waste of wealth time and effort in the arena of fierce competition"
"Ricardo in his book"
"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation rent of land Nations are merely production shops man is a machine for consuming and producing human life is a kind of capital economic laws blindly rule the world"

"The master who buys the worker 's labour at such a low price that it scarcely suffices for the worker 's most pressing needs is responsible neither for the inadequacy of the wage nor for the excessive duration of the labour he himself has to submit to the law which he imposes"
"Poverty is not so much caused by men as by the power of things"
"The inhabitants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital sufficient to improve and cultivate all their lands"
"The wool of the southern counties of Scotland is a great part of it after a long land carriage through very bad roads manufactured in Yorkshire for want of capital to manufacture it at home"

"I pp 306 07"
"The quantity of materials which the same number of people can work up increases in a great proportion as labour comes to be more and more subdivided and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to a greater degree of simplicity a variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitating and abridging those operations"
"As the division of labour advances therefore in order to give constant employment to an equal number of workmen an equal stock of provisions and a greater stock of materials and tools than what would have been necessary in a ruder state of things must be accumulated beforehand"
"As the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on this great improvement in the productive powers of labour so that accumulation naturally leads to this improvement"
"The person who employs his stock in maintaining labour necessarily wishes to employ it in such a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as possible"
"He endeavours therefore both to make among his workmen the most proper distribution of employment and to furnish them with the best machines which he can either invent or afford to purchase"
"His abilities in both these respects |XV 2| are generally in proportion to the extent of his stock or to the number of people whom it can employ"
"The quantity of industry therefore not only increases in every country with the increase of the stock which employs it but in consequence of that increase the same quantity of industry produces a much greater quantity of work"

"Already here and there closer association of the chief branches of production"
"Thus big manufacturers will try to acquire also large estates in order to become independent of others for at least a part of the raw materials required for their industry or they will go into trade in conjunction with their industrial enterprises not only to sell their own manufactures but also to purchase other kinds of products and to sell these to their workers"
"In England where a single factory owner sometimes employs ten to twelve thousand workers it is already not uncommon to find such combinations of various branches of production controlled by one brain such smaller states or provinces within the state"
"Thus the mine owners in the Birmingham area have recently taken over the whole process of iron production which was previously distributed among various entrepreneurs and owners See Der bergm � nnische Distrikt bei Birmingham Deutsche Vierteljahr Schrift"
"Finally in the large joint stock enterprises which have become so numerous we see far reaching combinations of the financial resources of many participants with the scientific and technical knowledge and skills of others to whom the carrying out of the work is handed over"

"Preface and Table of Contents | Rent of Land"
"||I 3| Landlords right has its origin in robbery"
"Say t. 1 p. 136 footnote"
"The landlords like all other men love to reap where they never sowed and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth"
"The rent of land it may be thought is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement"
"This no doubt may be partly the case upon some occasions"
"The landlord demands 1 a rent even for unimproved land and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent"
"Those improvements besides are not always made by the stock of the landlord but sometimes by that of the tenant"
"When the lease comes to be renewed however the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own"
"Smith cites as an instance of the last case kelp"
"It grows in several parts of Great Britain particularly in Scotland upon such rocks only as lie within the high water mark which are twice every day covered with the sea and of which the produce therefore was never augmented by human industry"
"The landlord however whose estate is bounded by a kelp shore of this kind demands a rent for it as much as for his corn fields"
"The sea in the neighborhood of the Islands of Shetland is more than commonly abundant in fish which make a great part of the subsistence of their inhabitants"
"But in order to profit by the produce of the water they must have a habitation upon the neighboring land"
"The rent of the landlord is in proportion not to what the farmer can make by the land but to what he can make both by the land and by the water"
"This rent may be considered as the produce of those powers of nature the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer"
"It is greater or smaller according to the supposed extent of those powers or in other words according to the supposed natural or improved fertility of the land"
"It is the work of nature which remains after deducting or compensating everything which can be regarded as the work of man"
"The rent of land therefore considered as the price paid for the use of the land is naturally a monopoly price"
"It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land or to what he can afford to take but to what the farmer can afford to give"
"Of the three original classes that of the landlords is the one whose revenue costs them neither labour nor care but comes to them as it were of its own accord and independent of any plan or project of their own"
"We have already learnt that the size of the rent depends on the degree of fertility of the land"
"Another factor in its determination is situation"
"The rent of land not only varies with its fertility whatever be its produce but with its situation whatever be its fertility"
"The produce of land mines and fisheries when their natural fertility is equal is in proportion to the extent and proper ||III 3| application of the capitals employed about them"
"When the capitals are equal and equally well applied it is in proportion to their natural fertility"
"These propositions of Smith are important because given equal costs of production and capital of equal size they reduce the rent of land to the greater or lesser fertility of the soil"
"Thereby showing clearly the perversion of concepts in political economy which turns the fertility of the land into an attribute of the landlord"
"Now however let us consider the rent of land as it is formed in real life"
"The rent of land is established as a result of the struggle between tenant and landlord"
"We find that the hostile antagonism of interests the struggle the war is recognized throughout political economy as the basis of social organization"
"Let us see now what the relations are between landlord and tenant"
"In adjusting the terms of the lease the landlord endeavors to leave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to keep up the stock from which he furnishes the seed pays the labour and purchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry together with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood"
"This is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content himself without being a loser and the landlord seldom means to leave him any more"
"Whatever part of the produce or what is the same thing whatever part of its price is over and above this share he naturally endeavors to reserve to himself as the rent of his land which is evidently the highest the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land"
"This portion however may still be considered as the natural rent of land or the rent for which it is naturally meant that land should for the most part be let"
"I pp 130 31"
"The landlords says Say operate a certain kind of monopoly against the tenants"
"The bargain struck between landlord and tenant is always advantageous to the former in the greatest possible degree"
"Besides the advantage he derives from the nature of the case he derives a further advantage from his position his larger fortune and greater credit and standing"
"But the first by itself suffices to enable him and him alone to profit from the favorable circumstances of the land"
"The opening of a canal or a road the increase of population and of the prosperity of a district always raises the rent"
"Indeed the tenant himself may improve the ground at his own expense but he only derives the profit from this capital for the duration of his lease with the expiry of which it remains with the proprietor of the land henceforth it is the latter who reaps the interest thereon without having made the outlay for there is now a proportionate increase in the rent"
"Rent considered as the price paid for the use of land is naturally the highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land"
"The rent of an estate above ground commonly amounts to what is supposed to be a third of the gross produce and it is generally a rent certain and independent of the occasional variations ||V 3| in the crop"
"Rent can not be paid on all commodities"
"For instance in many districts no rent is paid for stones"
"Such parts only of the produce of land can commonly be brought to market of which the ordinary price is sufficient to replace the stock which must be employed in bringing them thither together with its ordinary profits"
"If the ordinary price is more than this the surplus part of it will naturally go to the rent of the land"
"If it is not more though the commodity may be brought to market it can afford no rent to the landlord"
"Whether the price is or is not more depends upon the demand"
"Rent it is to be observed therefore enters into the composition of the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit"
"Food belongs to the products which always yield a rent"
"As men like all other animals naturally multiply in proportion to the means of their subsistence food is always"
"It can always purchase or command a greater or smaller ||VI 3| quantity of labour and somebody can always be found who is willing to do something in order to obtain it"
"The quantity of labour indeed which it can purchase is not always equal to what it could maintain if managed in the most economical manner on account of the high wages which are sometimes given to labour"
"But it can always purchase such a quantity of labour as it can maintain according to the rate at which the sort of labour is commonly maintained in the neighborhood"
"But land in almost any situation produces a greater quantity of food than what is sufficient to maintain all the labour necessary for bringing it to market in the most liberal way in which that labour is ever maintained"
"The surplus too is always more than sufficient to replace the stock which employed that labour together with its profits"
"Something therefore always remains for a rent to the landlord"
"Food is in this manner not only the original source of rent but every other part of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent derives that part of its value from the improvement of the powers of labour in producing food by means of the improvement and cultivation of land"
"Human food seems to be the only produce of land which always and necessarily affords some rent to the landlord"
"Countries are populous not in proportion to the number of people whom their produce can clothe and lodge but in proportion to that of those whom it can feed"
"After food clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind"
"||VIII 3| 15 Let us now see how the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits"
"2 We have already learnt from Say how the rent of land increases with railways etc with the improvement safety and multiplication of the means of communication"
"Every improvement in the circumstances of the society tends either directly or indirectly to raise the real rent of land to increase the real wealth of the landlord his power of purchasing the labour or the produce of the labour of other people"
"The extension of improvement and cultivation tends to raise it directly"
"The landlord ’s share of the produce necessarily increases with the increase of the produce"
"That rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land"
"the rise in the price of cattle for example tends too to raise the rent of land directly and in a still greater proportion"
"The real value of the landlord ’s share his real command of the labour of other people not only rises with the real value of the produce but the proportion of his share to the whole produce rises with it"
"That produce after the rise in its real price requires no more labour to collect it than before"
"A smaller proportion of it will therefore be sufficient to replace with the ordinary profit the stock which employs that labour"
"A greater proportion of it must consequently belong to the landlord"
"||IX 3| The greater demand for raw produce and therefore the rise in value may in part result from the increase of population and from the increase of their needs"
"But every new invention every new application in manufacture of a previously unused or little used raw material augments rent"
"Thus for example there was a tremendous rise in the rent of coal mines with the advent of the railways steamships etc"
"Besides this advantage which the landlord derives from manufacture discoveries and labour there is yet another as we shall presently see"
"All those improvements in the productive powers of labour which tend directly to reduce the real price of manufactures tend indirectly to raise the real rent of land"
"The landlord exchanges that part of his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption or what comes to the same thing the price of that part of it for manufactured produce"
"Whatever reduces the real price of the latter raises that of the former"
"An equal quantity of the former becomes thereby equivalent to a greater quantity of the latter and the landlord is enabled to purchase a greater quantity of the conveniences ornaments or luxuries which he has occasion for"
"But it is silly to conclude as Smith does that since the landlord exploits every benefit which comes to society ||X 3| the interest of the landlord is always identical with that of society"
"In the economic system under the rule of private property the interest which an individual has in society is in precisely inverse proportion to the interest society has in him just as the interest of the usurer in the spendthrift is by no means identical with the interest of the spendthrift"
"We shall mention only in passing the landlord ’s obsession with monopoly directed against the landed property of foreign countries from which the Corn Laws 16 for instance originate"
"Likewise we shall here pass over medieval serfdom the slavery in the colonies and the miserable condition of the country folk the day labourers in Great Britain"
"Let us confine ourselves to the propositions of political economy itself"
"The landlord being interested in the welfare of society means according to the principles of political economy that he is interested in the growth of its population and manufacture in the expansion of its needs in short in the increase of wealth and this increase of wealth is as we have already seen identical with the increase of poverty and slavery"
"The relation between increasing house rent and increasing poverty is an example of the landlord ’s interest in society for the ground rent the interest obtained from the land on which the house stands goes up with the rent of the house"
"According to the political economists themselves the landlord ’s interest is inimically opposed to the interest of the tenant farmer and thus already to a significant section of society"
"As the landlord can demand all the more rent from the tenant farmer the less wages the farmer pays and as the farmer forces down wages all the lower the more rent the landlord demands it follows that the interest of the landlord is just as hostile to that of the farm workers as is that of the manufacturers to their workers"
"He likewise forces down wages to the minimum"
"4 Since a real reduction in the price of manufactured products raises the rent of land the landowner has a direct interest in lowering the wages of industrial workers in competition amongst the capitalists in over production in all the misery associated with industrial production"
"While thus the landlord ’s interest far from being identical with the interest of society stands inimically opposed to the interest of tenant farmers farm labourers factory workers and capitalists on the other hand the interest of one landlord is not even identical with that of another on account of the competition which we will now consider"
"In general the relationship of large and small landed property is like that of big and small capital"
"But in addition there are special circumstances which lead inevitably to the accumulation of large landed property and to the absorption of small property by it"
"1 Nowhere does the relative number of workers and implements decrease more with increases in the size of the stock than in landed property"
"Likewise the possibility of all round exploitation of economizing production costs and of effective division of labour increases nowhere more with the size of the stock than in landed property"
"2 Big landed property accumulates to itself the interest on the capital which the tenant farmer has employed to improve the land"
"property has to employ its own capital and therefore does not get this profit at all"
"3 While every social improvement benefits the big estate it harms small property because it increases its need for ready cash"
"4 Two important laws concerning this competition remain to be considered α"
"The rent of the cultivated land of which the produce is human food regulates the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land"
"Therefore it regulates the rent of other land and can force it down to a minimum"
"The small landed proprietor working on his own land stands then to the big landowner in the same relation as an artisan possessing his own tool to the factory owner"
"Small property in land has become a mere instrument of labour"
"||XVI 1| 17 Rent entirely disappears for the small proprietor there remains to him at the most the interest on his capital and his wages"
"For rent can be driven down by competition till it is nothing more than the interest on capital not invested by the proprietor"
"In addition we have already learnt that with equal fertility and equally efficient exploitation of lands mines and fisheries the produce is proportionate to the size of the capital"
"Hence the victory of the big landowner"
"Similarly where equal capitals are employed the product is proportionate to the fertility"
"Hence where capitals are equal victory goes to the proprietor of the more fertile soil"
"A mine of any kind may be said to be either fertile or barren according as the quantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain quantity of labour is greater or less than what can be brought by an equal quantity from the greater part of other mines of the same kind"
"The most fertile coal mine too regulates the price of coal at all the other mines in its neighborhood"
"Both the proprietor and the undertaker of the work find the one that he can get a greater rent the other that he can get a greater profit by somewhat underselling all their neighbors"
"Their neighbors are soon obliged to sell at the same price though they can not so well afford it and though it always diminishes and sometimes takes away altogether both their rent and their profit"
"Some works are abandoned altogether others can afford no rent and can be wrought only by the proprietor"
"After the discovery of the mines of Peru the silver mines of Europe were the greater part of them abandoned"
"This was the case too with the mines of Cuba and St. Domingo and even with the ancient mines of Peru after the discovery of those of Potosi"
"What Smith here says of mines applies more or less to landed property generally δ"
"The ordinary market price of land it is to be observed depends everywhere upon the ordinary market rate of interest"
"If the rent of land should fall short of the interest of money by a greater difference nobody would buy land which would soon reduce its ordinary price"
"On the contrary if the advantages should much more than compensate the difference everybody would buy land which again would soon raise its ordinary price"
"From this relation of rent of land to interest on money it follows that rent must fall more and more so that eventually only the wealthiest people can live on rent"
"Hence the ever greater competition between landowners who do not lease their land to tenants"
"Ruin of some of these further accumulation of large landed property"
"This competition has the further consequence that a large part of landed property falls into the hands of the capitalists and that capitalists thus become simultaneously landowners just as the smaller landowners are on the whole already nothing more than capitalists"
"Similarly a section of large landowners become at the same time industrialists"
"The final consequence is thus the abolition of the distinction between capitalist and landowner so that there remain altogether only two classes of the population the working class and the class of capitalists"
"This huckstering with landed property the transformation of landed property into a commodity constitutes the final overthrow of the old and the final establishment of the money aristocracy"
"Romanticism always confuses the shamefulness of huckstering the land with the perfectly rational consequence inevitable and desirable within the realm of private property of the huckstering of private property in land"
"In the first place feudal landed property is already by its very nature huckstered land the earth which is estranged from man and hence confronts him in the shape of a few great lords"
"The domination of the land as an alien power over men is already inherent in feudal landed property"
"The serf is the adjunct of the land"
"Likewise the lord of an entailed estate the first born son belongs to the land"
"Indeed the dominion of private property begins with property in land that is its basis"
"But in feudal landed property the lord at least appears as the king of the estate"
"Similarly there still exists the semblance of a more intimate connection between the proprietor and the land than that of mere material wealth"
"The estate is individualized with its lord it has his rank is baronial or ducal with him has his privileges his jurisdiction his political position etc"
"It appears as the inorganic body of its lord"
"Hence the proverb nulle terre sans ma � tre"
"There is no land without its master"
"Ed which expresses the fusion of nobility and landed property"
"Similarly the rule of landed property does not appear directly as the rule of mere capital"
"For those belonging to it the estate is more like their fatherland"
"It is a constricted sort of nationality"
"In the same way feudal landed property gives its name to its lord as does a kingdom to its king"
"His family history the history of his house etc all this individualizes the estate for him and makes it literally his house personifies it"
"Similarly those working on the estate have not the position of day labourers but they are in part themselves his property as are serfs and in part they are bound to him by ties of respect allegiance and duty"
"His relation to them is therefore directly political and has likewise a human intimate side"
"Customs character etc vary from one estate to another and seem to be one with the land to which they belong whereas later it is only his purse and not his character his individuality which connects a man with an estate"
"Finally the feudal lord does not try to extract the utmost advantage from his land"
"Rather he consumes what is there and calmly leaves the worry of producing to the serfs and the tenants"
"Such is nobility ’s relationship to landed property which casts a romantic glory on its lords"
"It is necessary that this appearance be abolished that landed property the root of private property be dragged completely into the movement of private property and that it become a commodity that the rule of the proprietor appear as the undisguised rule of private property of capital freed of all political tincture that the relationship between proprietor and worker be reduced to the economic relationship of exploiter and exploited that all personal relationship between the proprietor and his property cease property becoming merely objective material wealth that the marriage of convenience should take the place of the marriage of honor with the land and that the land should likewise sink to the status of a commercial value like man"
"It is essential that that which is the root of landed property filthy self interest make its appearance too in its cynical form"
"It is essential that the immovable monopoly turn into the mobile and restless monopoly into competition and that the idle enjoyment of the products of other people ’s blood and sweat turn into a bustling commerce in the same commodity"
"The medieval proverb nulle terre sans seigneur"
"There is no land without its lord"
"Ed is thereby replaced by that other proverb l’argent n’a pas de ma � tre Money knows no master"
"Ed wherein is expressed the complete domination of dead matter over man"
"2 Concerning the argument of division or non division of landed property the following is to be observed"
"The division of landed property negates the large scale monopoly of property in land abolishes it but only by generalizing this monopoly"
"It does not abolish the source of monopoly private property"
"It attacks the existing form but not the essence of monopoly"
"The consequence is that it falls victim to the laws of private property"
"For the division of landed property corresponds to the movement of competition in the sphere of industry"
"In addition to the economic disadvantages of such a dividing up of the instruments of labour and the dispersal of labour to be clearly distinguished from the division of labour in separated labour the work is not shared out amongst many but each carries on the same work by himself it is a multiplication of the same work this division of land like that competition in industry necessarily turns again into accumulation"
"Therefore where the division of landed property takes place there remains nothing for it but to return to monopoly in a still more malignant form or to negate to abolish the division of landed property itself"
"To do that however is not to return to feudal ownership but to abolish private property in the soil altogether"
"The first abolition of monopoly is always its generalization the broadening of its existence"
"The abolition of monopoly once it has come to exist in its utmost breadth and inclusiveness is its total annihilation"
"Association applied to land shares the economic advantage of large scale landed property and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in land division namely equality"
"In the same way association also re establishes now on a rational basis no longer mediated by serfdom overlordship and the silly mysticism of property the intimate ties of man with the earth since the earth ceases to be an object of huckstering and through free labour and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal property of man"
"A great advantage of the division of landed property is that the masses which can no longer resign themselves to servitude perish through property in a different way than in industry"
"As for large landed property its defenders have always sophistically identified the economic advantages offered by large scale agriculture with large scale landed property as if it were not precisely as a result of the abolition of property that this advantage for one thing would receive its ||XX 2| greatest possible extension and for another only then would be of social benefit"
"In the same way they have attacked the huckstering spirit of small landed property as if large landed property did not contain huckstering latent within it even in its feudal form not to speak of the modern English form which combines the landlord ’s feudalism with the tenant farmer ’s huckstering and industry"
"Just as large landed property can return the reproach of monopoly leveled against it by partitioned land since partitioned land is also based on the monopoly of private property so can partitioned landed property likewise return to large landed property the reproach of partition since partition also prevails there though in a rigid and frozen form"
"Indeed private property rests altogether on partitioning"
"Moreover just as division of the land leads back to large landed property as a form of capital wealth so must feudal landed property necessarily lead to partitioning or at least fall into the hands of the capitalists turn and twist as it may"
"For large landed property as in England drives the overwhelming majority of the population into the arms of industry and reduces its own workers to utter wretchedness"
"Thus it engenders and enlarges the power of its enemy capital industry by throwing poor people and an entire activity of the country on to the other side"
"It makes the majority of the people of the country industrial and thus opponents of large landed property"
"Where industry has attained to great power as in England at the present time it progressively forces from large landed property its monopoly against foreign countries and throws it into competition with landed property abroad"
"For under the sway of industry landed property could keep its feudal grandeur secure only by means of monopolies against foreign countries thereby protecting itself against the general laws of trade which are incompatible with its feudal character"
"Once thrown into competition landed property obeys the laws of competition like every other commodity subjected to competition"
"It begins thus to fluctuate to decrease and to increase to fly from one hand to another and no law can keep it any longer in a few predestined hands"
"The immediate consequence is the splitting up of the land amongst many hands and in any case subjection to the power of industrial capitals"
"To the owner it yields the utmost possible rent to the tenant farmer the utmost possible profit on his capital"
"The workers on the land in consequence have already been reduced to the minimum and the class of tenant farmers already represents within landed property the power of industry and capital"
"As a result of foreign competition rent in most cases can no longer form an independent income"
"A large number of landowners are forced to displace tenant farmers some of whom in this way sink into the proletariat"
"On the other hand many tenant farmers will take over landed property for the big proprietors who with their comfortable incomes have mostly given themselves over to extravagance and for the most part are not competent to conduct large scale agriculture often possess neither the capital nor the ability for the exploitation of the land"
"Hence a section of this class too is completely ruined"
"Eventually wages which have already been reduced to a minimum must be reduced yet further to meet the new competition"
"This then necessarily leads to revolution"
"Landed property had to develop in each of these two ways so as to experience in both its necessary downfall just as industry both in the form of monopoly and in that of competition had to ruin itself so as to learn to believe in man"

"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844"
"||XXII| We have proceeded from the premises of political economy"
"We have accepted its language and its laws"
"We presupposed private property the separation of labor capital and land and of wages profit of capital and rent of land likewise division of labor competition the concept of exchange value etc"
"On the basis of political economy itself in its own words we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched of commodities that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production that the necessary result of competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form and that finally the distinction between capitalist and land rentier like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory worker disappears and that the whole of society must fall apart into the two classes property owners and propertyless workers"
"Political economy starts with the fact of private property it does not explain it to us"
"It does not comprehend these laws i.e. it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property"
"Political economy throws no light on the cause of the division between labor and capital and between capital and land"
"When for example it defines the relationship of wages to profit it takes the interest of the capitalists to be the ultimate cause i.e. it takes for granted what it is supposed to explain"
"Similarly competition comes in everywhere"
"It is explained from external circumstances"
"As to how far these external and apparently accidental circumstances are but the expression of a necessary course of development political economy teaches us nothing"
"We have seen how exchange itself appears to it as an accidental fact"
"The only wheels which political economy sets in motion are greed and the war amongst the greedy competition"
"Precisely because political economy does not grasp the way the movement is connected it was possible to oppose for instance the doctrine of competition to the doctrine of monopoly the doctrine of craft freedom to the doctrine of the guild the doctrine of the division of landed property to the doctrine of the big estate for competition freedom of the crafts and the division of landed property were explained and comprehended only as accidental premeditated and violent consequences of monopoly of the guild system and of feudal property not as their necessary inevitable and natural consequences"
"Now therefore we have to grasp the intrinsic connection between private property greed the separation of labor capital and landed property the connection of exchange and competition of value and the devaluation of man of monopoly and competition etc the connection between this whole estrangement and the money system"
"Do not let us go back to a fictitious primordial condition as the political economist does when he tries to explain"
"The economist assumes in the form of a fact of an event what he is supposed to deduce namely the necessary relationship between two things between for example division of labor and exchange"
"Thus the theologian explains the origin of evil by the fall of Man that is he assumes as a fact in historical form what has to be explained"
"We proceed from an actual economic fact"
"The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces the more his production increases in power and size"
"The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates"
"The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things"
"Labor produces not only commodities it produces itself and the worker as a commodity and this at the same rate at which it produces commodities in general"
"Labor ’s realization is its objectification"
"So much does the labor ’s realization appear as loss of realization that the worker loses realization to the point of starving to death"
"So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker is robbed of the objects most necessary not only for his life but for his work"
"Indeed labor itself becomes an object which he can obtain only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions"
"So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the less he can possess and the more he falls under the sway of his product capital"
"All these consequences are implied in the statement that the worker is related to the product of labor as to an alien object"
"For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself the more powerful becomes the alien world of objects which he creates over and against himself the poorer he himself his inner world becomes the less belongs to him as his own"
"It is the same in religion"
"The more man puts into God the less he retains in himself"
"The worker puts his life into the object but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object"
"Hence the greater this activity the more the worker lacks objects"
"Whatever the product of his labor is he is not"
"Therefore the greater this product the less is he himself"
"Let us now look more closely at the objectification at the production of the worker and in it at the estrangement the loss of the object of his product"
"The worker can create nothing without nature without the sensuous external world"
"It is the material on which his labor is realized in which it is active from which and by means of which it produces"
"But just as nature provides labor with the means of life in the sense that labor can not live without objects on which to operate on the other hand it also provides the means of life in the more restricted sense i.e. the means for the physical subsistence of the worker himself"
"Thus the more the worker by his labor appropriates the external world sensuous nature the more he deprives himself of the means of life in two respects first in that the sensuous external world more and more ceases to be an object belonging to his labor to be his labor ’s means of life and second in that it more and more ceases to be a means of life in the immediate sense means for the physical subsistence of the worker"
"In both respects therefore the worker becomes a servant of his object first in that he receives an object of labor i.e. in that he receives work and secondly in that he receives means of subsistence"
"This enables him to exist first as a worker and second as a physical subject"
"The height of this servitude is that it is only as a worker that he can maintain himself as a physical subject and that it is only as a physical subject that he is a worker"
"Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labor by not considering the direct relationship between the worker labor and production"
"It is true that labor produces for the rich wonderful things but for the worker it produces privation"
"It produces palaces but for the worker hovels"
"It produces beauty but for the worker deformity"
"It replaces labor by machines but it throws one section of the workers back into barbarous types of labor and it turns the other section into a machine"
"It produces intelligence but for the worker stupidity cretinism"
"The direct relationship of labor to its products is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production"
"The relationship of the man of means to the objects of production and to production itself is only a consequence of this first relationship and confirms it"
"We shall consider this other aspect later"
"When we ask then what is the essential relationship of labor we are asking about the relationship of the worker to production"
"Till now we have been considering the estrangement the alienation of the worker only in one of its aspects i.e. the worker ’s relationship to the products of his labor"
"But the estrangement is manifested not only in the result but in the act of production within the producing activity itself"
"How could the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from himself"
"The product is after all but the summary of the activity of production"
"If then the product of labor is alienation production itself must be active alienation the alienation of activity the activity of alienation"
"In the estrangement of the object of labor is merely summarized the estrangement the alienation in the activity of labor itself"
"What then constitutes the alienation of labor"
"First the fact that labor is external to the worker i.e. it does not belong to his intrinsic nature that in his work therefore he does not affirm himself but denies himself does not feel content but unhappy does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind"
"The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work and in his work feels outside himself"
"His labor is therefore not voluntary but coerced it is forced labor"
"It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it"
"Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists labor is shunned like the plague"
"Lastly the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else ’s that it does not belong to him that in it he belongs not to himself but to another"
"Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination of the human brain and the human heart operates on the individual independently of him that is operates as an alien divine or diabolical activity so is the worker ’s activity not his spontaneous activity"
"It belongs to another it is the loss of his self"
"As a result therefore man the worker only feels himself freely active in his animal functions eating drinking procreating or at most in his dwelling and in dressing up etc and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal"
"What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal"
"Certainly eating drinking procreating etc are also genuinely human functions"
"But taken abstractly separated from the sphere of all other human activity and turned into sole and ultimate ends they are animal functions"
"We have considered the act of estranging practical human activity labor in two of its aspects"
"This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world to the objects of nature as an alien world inimically opposed to him"
"This relation is the relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him it is activity as suffering strength as weakness begetting as emasculating the worker ’s own physical and mental energy his personal life for what is life but activity as an activity which is turned against him independent of him and not belonging to him"
"Here we have self estrangement as previously we had the estrangement of the thing"
"We have still a third aspect of estranged labor to deduce from the two already considered"
"Man is a species being 20 not only because in practice and in theory he adopts the species his own as well as those of other things as his object but and this is only another way of expressing it also because he treats himself as the actual living species because he treats himself as a universal and therefore a free being"
"The life of the species both in man and in animals consists physically in the fact that man like the animal lives on organic nature and the more universal man or the animal is the more universal is the sphere of inorganic nature on which he lives"
"Just as plants animals stones air light etc constitute theoretically a part of human consciousness partly as objects of natural science partly as objects of art his spiritual inorganic nature spiritual nourishment which he must first prepare to make palatable and digestible so also in the realm of practice they constitute a part of human life and human activity"
"Physically man lives only on these products of nature whether they appear in the form of food heating clothes a dwelling etc"
"The universality of man appears in practice precisely in the universality which makes all nature his inorganic body both inasmuch as nature is 1"
"his direct means of life and 2 the material the object and the instrument of his life activity"
"Nature is man ’s inorganic body nature that is insofar as it is not itself human body"
"In estranging from man 1 nature and 2 himself his own active functions his life activity estranged labor estranges the species from man"
"It changes for him the life of the species into a means of individual life"
"First it estranges the life of the species and individual life and secondly it makes individual life in its abstract form the purpose of the life of the species likewise in its abstract and estranged form"
"For labor life activity productive life itself appears to man in the first place merely as a means of satisfying a need the need to maintain physical existence"
"Yet the productive life is the life of the species"
"It is life engendering life"
"The whole character of a species its species character is contained in the character of its life activity and"
"free conscious activity is man ’s species character"
"Life itself appears only as a means to life"
"It does not distinguish itself from it"
"It is not a determination with which he directly merges"
"Conscious life activity distinguishes man immediately from animal life activity"
"It is just because of this that he is a species being"
"Or it is only because he is a species being that he is a conscious being i.e. that his own life is an object for him"
"Only because of that is his activity free activity"
"Estranged labor reverses the relationship so that it is just because man is a conscious being that he makes his life activity his essential being a mere means to his existence"
"In creating a world of objects by his personal activity in his work upon inorganic nature man proves himself a conscious species being i.e. as a being that treats the species as his own essential being or that treats itself as a species being"
"Admittedly animals also produce"
"They build themselves nests dwellings like the bees beavers ants etc"
"But an animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young"
"It produces one sidedly whilst man produces universally"
"It produces only under the dominion of immediate physical need whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom"
"An animal produces only itself whilst man reproduces the whole of nature"
"An animal forms only in accordance with the standard and the need of the species to which it belongs whilst man knows how to produce in accordance with the standard of every species and knows how to apply everywhere the inherent standard to the object"
"Man therefore also forms objects in accordance with the laws of beauty"
"This production is his active species life"
"Through this production nature appears as his work and his reality"
"The object of labor is therefore the objectification of man ’s species life for he duplicates himself not only as in consciousness intellectually but also actively in reality and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created"
"In tearing away from man the object of his production therefore estranged labor tears from him his species life his real objectivity as a member of the species and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body nature is taken from him"
"Similarly in degrading spontaneous free activity to a means estranged labor makes man ’s species life a means to his physical existence"
"The consciousness which man has of his species is thus transformed by estrangement in such a way that species[-life becomes for him a means"
"Estranged labor turns thus 3"
"Man ’s species being both nature and his spiritual species property into a being alien to him into a means of his individual existence"
"It estranges from man his own body as well as external nature and his spiritual aspect his human aspect"
"An immediate consequence of the fact that man is estranged from the product of his labor from his life activity from his species being is the estrangement of man from man"
"When man confronts himself he confronts the other man"
"What applies to a man ’s relation to his work to the product of his labor and to himself also holds of a man ’s relation to the other man and to the other man ’s labor and object of labor"
"In fact the proposition that man ’s species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other as each of them is from man ’s essential nature"
"The estrangement of man and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself is realized and expressed only in the relationship in which a man stands to other men"
"Hence within the relationship of estranged labor each man views the other in accordance with the standard and the relationship in which he finds himself as a worker"
"We took our departure from a fact of political economy the estrangement of the worker and his production"
"We have formulated this fact in conceptual terms as estranged alienated labor"
"We have analyzed this concept hence analyzing merely a fact of political economy"
"Let us now see further how the concept of estranged alienated labor must express and present itself in real life"
"If the product of labor is alien to me if it confronts me as an alien power to whom then does it belong"
"Who is this being"
"To be sure in the earliest times the principal production for example the building of temples etc in Egypt India and Mexico appears to be in the service of the gods and the product belongs to the gods"
"However the gods on their own were never the lords of labor"
"No more was nature"
"And what a contradiction it would be if the more man subjugated nature by his labor and the more the miracles of the gods were rendered superfluous by the miracles of industry the more man were to renounce the joy of production and the enjoyment of the product to please these powers"
"The alien being to whom labor and the product of labor belongs in whose service labor is done and for whose benefit the product of labor is provided can only be man himself"
"If the worker ’s activity is a torment to him to another it must give satisfaction and pleasure"
"Not the gods not nature but only man himself can be this alien power over man"
"We must bear in mind the previous proposition that man ’s relation to himself becomes for him objective and actual through his relation to the other man"
"Thus if the product of his labor his labor objectified is for him an alien hostile powerful object independent of him then his position towards it is such that someone else is master of this object someone who is alien hostile powerful and independent of him"
"Every self estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself"
"For this reason religious self estrangement necessarily appears in the relationship of the layman to the priest or again to a mediator etc since we are here dealing with the intellectual world"
"In the real practical world self estrangement can only become manifest through the real practical relationship to other men"
"The medium through which estrangement takes place is itself practical"
"Thus through estranged labor man not only creates his relationship to the object and to the act of production as to powers in the manuscript Menschen men instead of M � chte powers"
"Just as he creates his own production as the loss of his reality as his punishment his own product as a loss as a product not belonging to him so he creates the domination of the person who does not produce over production and over the product"
"Just as he estranges his own activity from himself so he confers upon the stranger an activity which is not his own"
"We have until now considered this relationship only from the standpoint of the worker and later on we shall be considering it also from the standpoint of the non worker"
"The relationship of the worker to labor creates the relation to it of the capitalist or whatever one chooses to call the master of labor"
"Private property is thus the product the result the necessary consequence of alienated labor of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself"
"True it is as a result of the movement of private property that we have obtained the concept of alienated labor of alienated life in political economy"
"Later this relationship becomes reciprocal"
"Only at the culmination of the development of private property does this its secret appear again namely that on the one hand it is the product of alienated labor and that on the other it is the means by which labor alienates itself the realization of this alienation"
"This exposition immediately sheds light on various hitherto unsolved conflicts"
"1 Political economy starts from labor as the real soul of production yet to labor it gives nothing and to private property everything"
"Confronting this contradiction Proudhon has decided in favor of labor against private property[21"
"We understand however that this apparent contradiction is the contradiction of estranged labor with itself and that political economy has merely formulated the laws of estranged labor"
"We also understand therefore that wages and private property are identical"
"Indeed where the product as the object of labor pays for labor itself there the wage is but a necessary consequence of labor ’s estrangement"
"Likewise in the wage of labor labor does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage"
"We shall develop this point later and meanwhile will only draw some conclusions"
"Indeed even the equality of wages as demanded by Proudhon only transforms the relationship of the present day worker to his labor into the relationship of all men to labor"
"Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labor and estranged labor is the direct cause of private property"
"The downfall of the one must therefore involve the downfall of the other"
"2 From the relationship of estranged labor to private property it follows further that the emancipation of society from private property etc from servitude is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workers not that their emancipation alone is at stake but because the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation and it contains this because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production and all relations of servitude are but modifications and consequences of this relation"
"Just as we have derived the concept of private property from the concept of estranged alienated labor by analysis so we can develop every category of political economy with the help of these two factors and we shall find again in each category e.g. trade competition capital money only a particular and developed expression of these first elements"
"But before considering this phenomenon however let us try to solve two other problems"
"1 To define the general nature of private property as it has arisen as a result of estranged labor in its relation to truly human and social property"
"2 We have accepted the estrangement of labor its alienation as a fact and we have analyzed this fact"
"How is this estrangement rooted in the nature of human development"
"We have already gone a long way to the solution of this problem by transforming the question of the origin of private property into the question of the relation of alienated labor to the course of humanity ’s development"
"For when one speaks of private property one thinks of dealing with something external to man"
"When one speaks of labor one is directly dealing with man himself"
"This new formulation of the question already contains its solution"
"As to 1 The general nature of private property and its relation to truly human property"
"Appropriation appears as estrangement as alienation and alienation appears as appropriation estrangement as truly becoming a citizen.[23 We have considered the one side alienated labor in relation to the worker himself i.e. the relation of alienated labor to itself"
"Private property as the material summary expression of alienated labor embraces both relations the relation of the worker to work and to the product of his labor and to the non worker and the relation of the non worker to the worker and to the product of his labor"
"Having seen that in relation to the worker who appropriates nature by means of his labor this appropriation appears as estrangement his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as activity of another vitality as a sacrifice of life production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power to an alien person we shall now consider the relation to the worker to labor and its object of this person who is alien to labor and the worker"
"Secondly that the worker ’s real practical attitude in production and to the product as a state of mind appears in the non worker who confronting him as a theoretical attitude"
"Thirdly the non worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker"
"First Manuscript breaks off here"
"Preface and Table of Contents | Private Property Communism Karl Marx Internet Archive"
"||XXII| We have proceeded from the premises of political economy"
"We have accepted its language and its laws"
"We presupposed private property the separation of labor capital and land and of wages profit of capital and rent of land likewise division of labor competition the concept of exchange value etc"
"On the basis of political economy itself in its own words we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched of commodities that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production that the necessary result of competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form and that finally the distinction between capitalist and land rentier like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory worker disappears and that the whole of society must fall apart into the two classes property owners and propertyless workers"
"Political economy starts with the fact of private property it does not explain it to us"
"It expresses in general abstract formulas the material process through which private property actually passes and these formulas it then takes for laws"
"It does not comprehend these laws i.e. it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property"
"Political economy throws no light on the cause of the division between labor and capital and between capital and land"
"When for example it defines the relationship of wages to profit it takes the interest of the capitalists to be the ultimate cause i.e. it takes for granted what it is supposed to explain"
"It is explained from external circumstances"
"As to how far these external and apparently accidental circumstances are but the expression of a necessary course of development political economy teaches us nothing"
"We have seen how exchange itself appears to it as an accidental fact"
"The only wheels which political economy sets in motion are greed and the war amongst the greedy competition"
"Precisely because political economy does not grasp the way the movement is connected it was possible to oppose for instance the doctrine of competition to the doctrine of monopoly the doctrine of craft freedom to the doctrine of the guild the doctrine of the division of landed property to the doctrine of the big estate for competition freedom of the crafts and the division of landed property were explained and comprehended only as accidental premeditated and violent consequences of monopoly of the guild system and of feudal property not as their necessary inevitable and natural consequences"
"Now therefore we have to grasp the intrinsic connection between private property greed the separation of labor capital and landed property the connection of exchange and competition of value and the devaluation of man of monopoly and competition etc the connection between this whole estrangement and the money system"
"Do not let us go back to a fictitious primordial condition as the political economist does when he tries to explain"
"Such a primordial condition explains nothing it merely pushes the question away into a grey nebulous distance"
"The economist assumes in the form of a fact of an event what he is supposed to deduce namely the necessary relationship between two things between for example division of labor and exchange"
"Thus the theologian explains the origin of evil by the fall of Man that is he assumes as a fact in historical form what has to be explained"
"We proceed from an actual economic fact"
"The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces the more his production increases in power and size"
"The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates"
"The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things"
"Labor produces not only commodities it produces itself and the worker as a commodity and this at the same rate at which it produces commodities in general"
"This fact expresses merely that the object which labor produces labor ’s product confronts it as something alien as a power independent of the producer"
"The product of labor is labor which has been embodied in an object which has become material it is the objectification of labor"
"Under these economic conditions this realization of labor appears as loss of realization for the workers[18 objectification as loss of the object and bondage to it appropriation as estrangement as alienation.[19"
"So much does the labor ’s realization appear as loss of realization that the worker loses realization to the point of starving to death"
"Indeed labor itself becomes an object which he can obtain only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions"
"So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the less he can possess and the more he falls under the sway of his product capital"

"The worker puts his life into the object but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object"
"Hence the greater this activity the more the worker lacks objects"
"Whatever the product of his labor is he is not"
"Therefore the greater this product the less is he himself"
"The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object an external existence but that it exists outside him independently as something alien to him and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him"
"It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien"
"Let us now look more closely at the objectification at the production of the worker and in it at the estrangement the loss of the object of his product"
"The worker can create nothing without nature without the sensuous external world"
"But just as nature provides labor with the means of life in the sense that labor can not live without objects on which to operate on the other hand it also provides the means of life in the more restricted sense i.e. the means for the physical subsistence of the worker himself"
"Thus the more the worker by his labor appropriates the external world sensuous nature the more he deprives himself of the means of life in two respects first in that the sensuous external world more and more ceases to be an object belonging to his labor to be his labor ’s means of life and second in that it more and more ceases to be a means of life in the immediate sense means for the physical subsistence of the worker"
"In both respects therefore the worker becomes a servant of his object first in that he receives an object of labor i.e. in that he receives work and secondly in that he receives means of subsistence"
"This enables him to exist first as a worker and second as a physical subject"
"The height of this servitude is that it is only as a worker that he can maintain himself as a physical subject and that it is only as a physical subject that he is a worker"
"According to the economic laws the estrangement of the worker in his object is expressed thus the more the worker produces the less he has to consume the more values he creates the more valueless the more unworthy he becomes the better formed his product the more deformed becomes the worker the more civilized his object the more barbarous becomes the worker the more powerful labor becomes the more powerless becomes the worker the more ingenious labor becomes the less ingenious becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature ’s slave"
"Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labor by not considering the direct relationship between the worker labor and production"
"It is true that labor produces for the rich wonderful things but for the worker it produces privation"
"It produces palaces but for the worker hovels"
"It produces beauty but for the worker deformity"
"It produces intelligence but for the worker stupidity cretinism"
"The direct relationship of labor to its products is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production"

"External labor labor in which man alienates himself is a labor of self sacrifice of mortification"
"Lastly the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else ’s that it does not belong to him that in it he belongs not to himself but to another"
"Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination of the human brain and the human heart operates on the individual independently of him that is operates as an alien divine or diabolical activity so is the worker ’s activity not his spontaneous activity"
"It belongs to another it is the loss of his self"
"What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal"
"Certainly eating drinking procreating etc are also genuinely human functions"
"But taken abstractly separated from the sphere of all other human activity and turned into sole and ultimate ends they are animal functions"
"The relation of the worker to the product of labor as an alien object exercising power over him"

"Here we have self estrangement as previously we had the estrangement of the thing"
"We have still a third aspect of estranged labor to deduce from the two already considered"
"The life of the species both in man and in animals consists physically in the fact that man like the animal lives on organic nature and the more universal man or the animal is the more universal is the sphere of inorganic nature on which he lives"
"Just as plants animals stones air light etc constitute theoretically a part of human consciousness partly as objects of natural science partly as objects of art his spiritual inorganic nature spiritual nourishment which he must first prepare to make palatable and digestible so also in the realm of practice they constitute a part of human life and human activity"
"Physically man lives only on these products of nature whether they appear in the form of food heating clothes a dwelling etc"
"The universality of man appears in practice precisely in the universality which makes all nature his inorganic body both inasmuch as nature is 1"
"Nature is man ’s inorganic body nature that is insofar as it is not itself human body"
"Man lives on nature means that nature is his body with which he must remain in continuous interchange if he is not to die"
"That man ’s physical and spiritual life is linked to nature means simply that nature is linked to itself for man is a part of nature"
"In estranging from man 1 nature and 2 himself his own active functions his life activity estranged labor estranges the species from man"
"It changes for him the life of the species into a means of individual life"

"The object of labor is therefore the objectification of man ’s species life for he duplicates himself not only as in consciousness intellectually but also actively in reality and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created"
"In tearing away from man the object of his production therefore estranged labor tears from him his species life his real objectivity as a member of the species and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body nature is taken from him"
"Similarly in degrading spontaneous free activity to a means estranged labor makes man ’s species life a means to his physical existence"
"The consciousness which man has of his species is thus transformed by estrangement in such a way that species[-life becomes for him a means"
"Man ’s species being both nature and his spiritual species property into a being alien to him into a means of his individual existence"
"It estranges from man his own body as well as external nature and his spiritual aspect his human aspect"
"An immediate consequence of the fact that man is estranged from the product of his labor from his life activity from his species being is the estrangement of man from man"
"When man confronts himself he confronts the other man"
"What applies to a man ’s relation to his work to the product of his labor and to himself also holds of a man ’s relation to the other man and to the other man ’s labor and object of labor"
"In fact the proposition that man ’s species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other as each of them is from man ’s essential nature"
"The estrangement of man and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself is realized and expressed only in the relationship in which a man stands to other men"
"Hence within the relationship of estranged labor each man views the other in accordance with the standard and the relationship in which he finds himself as a worker"
"We took our departure from a fact of political economy the estrangement of the worker and his production"
"We have formulated this fact in conceptual terms as estranged alienated labor"
"We have analyzed this concept hence analyzing merely a fact of political economy"
"Let us now see further how the concept of estranged alienated labor must express and present itself in real life"
"If the product of labor is alien to me if it confronts me as an alien power to whom then does it belong"
"To be sure in the earliest times the principal production for example the building of temples etc in Egypt India and Mexico appears to be in the service of the gods and the product belongs to the gods"
"However the gods on their own were never the lords of labor"
"No more was nature"
"And what a contradiction it would be if the more man subjugated nature by his labor and the more the miracles of the gods were rendered superfluous by the miracles of industry the more man were to renounce the joy of production and the enjoyment of the product to please these powers"
"The alien being to whom labor and the product of labor belongs in whose service labor is done and for whose benefit the product of labor is provided can only be man himself"
"If the product of labor does not belong to the worker if it confronts him as an alien power then this can only be because it belongs to some other man than the worker"
"If the worker ’s activity is a torment to him to another it must give satisfaction and pleasure"
"Not the gods not nature but only man himself can be this alien power over man"
"We must bear in mind the previous proposition that man ’s relation to himself becomes for him objective and actual through his relation to the other man"
"Thus if the product of his labor his labor objectified is for him an alien hostile powerful object independent of him then his position towards it is such that someone else is master of this object someone who is alien hostile powerful and independent of him"
"If he treats his own activity as an unfree activity then he treats it as an activity performed in the service under the dominion the coercion and the yoke of another man"
"Every self estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself"
"For this reason religious self estrangement necessarily appears in the relationship of the layman to the priest or again to a mediator etc since we are here dealing with the intellectual world"
"In the real practical world self estrangement can only become manifest through the real practical relationship to other men"
"The medium through which estrangement takes place is itself practical"
"Thus through estranged labor man not only creates his relationship to the object and to the act of production as to powers in the manuscript Menschen men instead of M � chte powers"
"Just as he creates his own production as the loss of his reality as his punishment his own product as a loss as a product not belonging to him so he creates the domination of the person who does not produce over production and over the product"
"Just as he estranges his own activity from himself so he confers upon the stranger an activity which is not his own"
"We have until now considered this relationship only from the standpoint of the worker and later on we shall be considering it also from the standpoint of the non worker"
"Through estranged alienated labor then the worker produces the relationship to this labor of a man alien to labor and standing outside it"
"The relationship of the worker to labor creates the relation to it of the capitalist or whatever one chooses to call the master of labor"
"Private property is thus the product the result the necessary consequence of alienated labor of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself"
"Private property thus results by analysis from the concept of alienated labor i.e. of alienated man of estranged labor of estranged life of estranged man"
"True it is as a result of the movement of private property that we have obtained the concept of alienated labor of alienated life in political economy"
"But on analysis of this concept it becomes clear that though private property appears to be the reason the cause of alienated labor it is rather its consequence just as the gods are originally not the cause but the effect of man ’s intellectual confusion"
"Later this relationship becomes reciprocal"
"Only at the culmination of the development of private property does this its secret appear again namely that on the one hand it is the product of alienated labor and that on the other it is the means by which labor alienates itself the realization of this alienation"
"This exposition immediately sheds light on various hitherto unsolved conflicts"
"1 Political economy starts from labor as the real soul of production yet to labor it gives nothing and to private property everything"
"Confronting this contradiction Proudhon has decided in favor of labor against private property[21"
"We understand however that this apparent contradiction is the contradiction of estranged labor with itself and that political economy has merely formulated the laws of estranged labor"
"We also understand therefore that wages and private property are identical"
"Indeed where the product as the object of labor pays for labor itself there the wage is but a necessary consequence of labor ’s estrangement"
"Likewise in the wage of labor labor does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage"
"We shall develop this point later and meanwhile will only draw some conclusions"
"An enforced increase of wages disregarding all other difficulties including the fact that it would only be by force too that such an increase being an anomaly could be maintained would therefore be nothing but better payment for the slave and would not win either for the worker or for labor their human status and dignity"
"Indeed even the equality of wages as demanded by Proudhon only transforms the relationship of the present day worker to his labor into the relationship of all men to labor"
"Society would then be conceived as an abstract capitalist"
"Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labor and estranged labor is the direct cause of private property"
"The downfall of the one must therefore involve the downfall of the other"
"2 From the relationship of estranged labor to private property it follows further that the emancipation of society from private property etc from servitude is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workers not that their emancipation alone is at stake but because the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation and it contains this because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production and all relations of servitude are but modifications and consequences of this relation"
"Just as we have derived the concept of private property from the concept of estranged alienated labor by analysis so we can develop every category of political economy with the help of these two factors and we shall find again in each category e.g. trade competition capital money only a particular and developed expression of these first elements"
"But before considering this phenomenon however let us try to solve two other problems"
"1 To define the general nature of private property as it has arisen as a result of estranged labor in its relation to truly human and social property"
"2 We have accepted the estrangement of labor its alienation as a fact and we have analyzed this fact"
"How we now ask does man come to alienate to estrange his labor"
"How is this estrangement rooted in the nature of human development"
"We have already gone a long way to the solution of this problem by transforming the question of the origin of private property into the question of the relation of alienated labor to the course of humanity ’s development"
"For when one speaks of private property one thinks of dealing with something external to man"
"When one speaks of labor one is directly dealing with man himself"
"This new formulation of the question already contains its solution"
"As to 1 The general nature of private property and its relation to truly human property"
"Alienated labor has resolved itself for us into two components which depend on one another or which are but different expressions of one and the same relationship"
"Appropriation appears as estrangement as alienation and alienation appears as appropriation estrangement as truly becoming a citizen.[23"
"We have considered the one side alienated labor in relation to the worker himself i.e. the relation of alienated labor to itself"
"The product the necessary outcome of this relationship as we have seen is the property relation of the non worker to the worker and to labor"
"Private property as the material summary expression of alienated labor embraces both relations the relation of the worker to work and to the product of his labor and to the non worker and the relation of the non worker to the worker and to the product of his labor"
"Having seen that in relation to the worker who appropriates nature by means of his labor this appropriation appears as estrangement his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as activity of another vitality as a sacrifice of life production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power to an alien person we shall now consider the relation to the worker to labor and its object of this person who is alien to labor and the worker"
"First it has to be noted that everything which appears in the worker as an activity of alienation of estrangement appears in the non worker as a state of alienation of estrangement"
"Secondly that the worker ’s real practical attitude in production and to the product as a state of mind appears in the non worker who confronting him as a theoretical attitude"
"||XXVII| Thirdly the non worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker"
"Let us look more closely at these three relations"
"Preface and Table of Contents | Private Property Communism Karl Marx Internet Archive"
"forms the interest on his capital"
"The worker is the subjective manifestation of the fact that capital is man wholly lost to himself just as capital is the objective manifestation of the fact that labour is man lost to himself"
"But the worker has the misfortune to be a living capital and therefore an indigent capital one which loses its interest and hence its livelihood every moment it is not working"
"The value of the worker as capital rises according to demand and supply and physically too his existence his life was and is looked upon as a supply of a commodity like any other"
"The worker produces capital capital produces him hence he produces himself and man as worker as a commodity is the product of this entire cycle"
"To the man who is nothing more than a worker and to him as a worker his human qualities only exist insofar as they exist for capital alien to him"
"Because man and capital are alien foreign to each other however and thus stand in an indifferent external and accidental relationship to each other it is inevitable that this foreignness should also appear as something real"
"As soon therefore as it occurs to capital whether from necessity or caprice no longer to be for the worker he himself is no longer for himself he has no work hence no wages and since he has no existence as a human being but only as a worker he can go and bury himself starve to death etc"
"The worker exists as a worker only when he exists for himself as capital and he exists as capital only when some capital exists for him"
"The existence of capital is his existence his life as it determines the tenor of his life in a manner indifferent to him"
"Political economy therefore does not recognise the unemployed worker the workingman insofar as he happens to be outside this labour relationship"
"For it therefore the worker 's needs are but the one need to maintain him whilst he is working and insofar as may be necessary to prevent the race of labourers from dying out"
"The wages of labour have thus exactly the same significance as the maintenance and servicing of any other productive instrument or as the consumption of capital in general required for its reproduction with interest like the oil which is applied to wheels to keep them turning"
"Wages therefore belong to capital 's and the capitalist 's necessary costs and must not exceed the bounds of this necessity"
"It was therefore quite logical for the English factory owners before the Amendment Bill of 1834 to deduct from the wages of the worker the public charity which he was receiving out of the Poor Rate and to consider this to be an integral part of wages"
"Production does not simply produce man as a commodity the human commodity man in the role of commodity it produces him in keeping with this role as a mentally and physically dehumanised being"
"Its product is the self conscious and self acting commodity"
"Great advance of Ricardo Mill etc on Smith and Say to declare the existence of the human being the greater or lesser human productivity of the commodity to be indifferent and even harmful"
"Not how many workers are maintained by a given capital but rather how much interest it brings in the sum total of the annual savings is said to be the true purpose of production"
"It was likewise a great and consistent advance of modern English political economy that whilst elevating labour to the position of its sole principle it should at the same time expound with complete clarity the inverse relation between wages and interest on capital and the fact that the capitalist could normally only gain by pressing down wages and vice versa"
"Not the defrauding of the consumer but the capitalist and the worker taking advantage of each other is shown to be the normal relationship"
"The relations of private property contain latent within them the relation of private property as labour the relation of private property as capital and the mutual relation of these two to one another"
"There is the production of human activity as labour that is as an activity quite alien to itself to man and to nature and therefore to consciousness and the expression of life the abstract existence of man as a mere workman who may therefore daily fall from his filled void into the absolute void into his social and therefore actual non existence"
"On the other hand there is the production of the object of human activity as capital in which all the natural and social characteristic of the object is extinguished in which private property has lost its natural and social quality and therefore every political and social illusion and is not associated with any apparently human relations in which the selfsame capital remains the same in the most diverse natural and social manifestations totally indifferent to its real content"
"It is therefore another great achievement of modern English political economy to have declared rent of land to be the difference in the interest yielded by the worst and the best land under cultivation to have exposed the landowner 's romantic illusions his alleged social importance and the identity of his interest with the interest of society a view still maintained by Adam Smith after the Physiocrats and to have anticipated and prepared the movement of the real world which will transform the landowner into an ordinary prosaic capitalist and thus simplify and sharpen the contradiction between capital and labour and"
"Land as land and rent as rent have lost their distinction of rank and become insignificant capital and interest or rather capital and interest that signify only money"
"The distinction between capital and land between profit and rent and between both and wages and industry and agriculture and immovable and movable private property this distinction is not rooted in the nature of things but is a historical distinction a fixed historical moment in the formation and development of the contradiction between capital and labour"
"This distinction only continues to exist as a special sort of work as an essential important and life embracing distinction so long as industry town life develops over and against landed property aristocratic feudal life and itself continues to bear the feudal character of its opposite in the form of monopoly craft guild corporation etc within which labour still has a seemingly social significance still the significance of the real community and has not yet reached the stage of indifference to its content of complete being for self[25 i. e. of abstraction from all other being and hence has not yet become liberated capital"
"But liberated industry industry constituted for itself as such and liberated capital are the necessary development of labour"
"With the transformation of the slave into a free worker i.e. into a hireling the landlord himself is transformed into a captain of industry into a capitalist a transformation which takes place at first through the intermediacy of the tenant farmer"
"Thus in the person of the tenant farmer the landlord has already become in essence a common capitalist"
"And this must come to pass too in actual fact"
"the capitalist engaged in agriculture the tenant must become a landlord or vice versa"
"The tenant 's industrial hucksterism is the landowner 's industrial hucksterism for the being of the former postulates the being of the latter"
"But mindful of their contrasting origin of their line of descent the landowner knows the capitalist as his insolent liberated enriched slave of yesterday and sees himself as a capitalist who is threatened by him"
"The capitalist knows the landowner as the idle cruel egotistical master of yesterday he knows that he injures him as a capitalist but that it is to industry that he owes all his present social significance his possessions and his pleasures he sees in him a contradiction to free industry and to free capital to capital independent of every natural limitation"
"This contradiction is extremely bitter and each side tells the truth about the other"
"One need only read the attacks of immovable on movable property and vice versa to obtain a clear picture of their respective worthlessness"
"The landowner lays stress on the noble lineage of his property on feudal souvenirs or reminiscences the poetry of recollection on his romantic disposition on his political importance etc and when he talks economics it is only agriculture that he holds to be productive"
"At the same time he depicts his adversary as a sly hawking carping deceitful greedy mercenary rebellious heartless and spiritless person who is estranged from the community and freely trades it away who breeds nourishes and cherishes competition and with it pauperism crime and the dissolution of all social bonds an extorting pimping servile smooth flattering fleecing dried up rogue without honour principles poetry substance or anything else"
"Amongst others see the Physiocrat Bergasse whom Camille Desmoulins flays in his journal R � volutions de France et de Brabant 26 see von Vincke Lancizolle Haller Leo Kosegarten and also Sismondi"
"See on the other hand the garrulous old Hegelian theologian Funke who tells after Herr Leo with tears in his eyes how a slave had refused when serfdom was abolished to cease being the property of the gentry 27"
"See also the patriotic visions of Justus M � ser which distinguish themselves by the fact that they never for a moment abandon the respectable petty bourgeois home baked ordinary narrow horizon of the philistine and which nevertheless remain pure fancy"
"This contradiction has given them such an appeal to the German heart.- Note by Marx"
"Movable property for its part points to the miracles of industry and progress"
"It is the child of modern times whose legitimate native born son it is"
"It pities its adversary as a simpleton unenlightened about his own nature and in this it is completely right who wants to replace moral capital and free labour by brute immoral violence and serfdom"
"It depicts him as a Don Quixote who under the guise of bluntness respectability the general interest and stability conceals incapacity for progress greedy self indulgence selfishness sectional interest and evil intent"
"It claims to have obtained political freedom for everybody to have loosed the chains which fettered civil society to have linked together different worlds to have created trade promoting friendship between the peoples to have created pure morality and a pleasant culture to have given the people civilised needs in place of their crude wants and the means of satisfying them"
"Meanwhile it claims the landowner this idle parasitic grain profiteer raises the price of the people 's basic necessities and so forces the capitalist to raise wages without being able to increase productivity thus impeding the growth of the nation 's annual income the accumulation of capital and therefore the possibility of providing work for the people and wealth for the country eventually cancelling it thus producing a general decline whilst he parasitically exploits every advantage of modern civilisation without doing the least thing for it and without even abating in the slightest his feudal prejudices"
"Finally let him for whom the cultivation of the land and the land itself exist only as a source of money which comes to him as a present let him just take a look at his tenant farmer and say whether he himself is not a downright fantastic sly scoundrel who in his heart and in actual fact has for a long time belonged to free industry and to lovely trade however much he may protest and prattle about historical memories and ethical or political goals"
"Everything which he can really advance to justify himself is true only of the cultivator of the land the capitalist and the labourers of whom the landowner is rather the enemy"
"Thus he gives evidence against himself"
"Movable property claims that without capital landed property is dead worthless matter that its civilised victory has discovered and made human labour the source of wealth in place of the dead thing"
"See Paul Louis Courier Saint Simon Ganilh Ricardo Mill McCulloch and Destutt de Tracy and Michel Chevalier"
"The real course of development to be inserted at this point results in the necessary victory of the capitalist over the landowner"
"that is to say of developed over undeveloped immature private property just as in general movement must triumph over immobility open self conscious baseness over hidden unconscious baseness cupidity over self indulgence the avowedly restless adroit self interest of enlightenment over the parochial worldly wise respectable idle and fantastic self interest of superstition and money over the other forms of private property"
"Those states which sense something of the danger attaching to fully developed free industry to fully developed pure morality and to fully developed philanthropic trade try but in vain to hold in check the capitalisation of landed property"
"Landed property in its distinction from capital is private property capital still afflicted with local and political prejudices it is capital which has not yet extricated itself from its entanglement with the world and found the form proper to itself capital not yet fully developed"
"It must achieve its abstract that is its pure expression in the course of its cosmogony"
"The character of private property is expressed by labour capital and the relations between these two"

"The subjective essence of private property private property as activity for itself 29 as subject as person is labour"
"It is therefore evident that only the political economy which acknowledged labour as its principle Adam Smith and which therefore no longer looked upon private property as a mere condition external to man that it is this political economy which has to be regarded on the one hand as a product of the real energy and the real movement of private property it is a movement of private property become independent for itself in consciousness the modern industry as Self as a product of modern industry and on the other hand as a force which has quickened and glorified the energy and development of modern industry and made it a power in the realm of consciousness"
"To this enlightened political economy which has discovered within private property the subjective essence of wealth the adherents of the monetary and mercantile system who look upon private property only as an objective substance confronting men seem therefore to be fetishists Catholics"
"Engels was therefore right to call Adam Smith the Luther of Political Economy"
"See Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy"
"Just as Luther recognised religion faith as the substance of the external world and in consequence stood opposed to Catholic paganism just as he superseded external religiosity by making religiosity the inner substance of man just as he negated the priests outside the layman because he transplanted the priest into laymen 's hearts just so with wealth wealth as something outside man and independent of him and therefore as something to be maintained and asserted only in an external fashion is done away with that is this external mindless objectivity of wealth is done away with with private property being incorporated in man himself and with man himself being recognised as its essence"
"But as a result man is brought within the orbit of private property just as with Luther he is brought within the orbit of religion"
"Under the semblance of recognising man the political economy whose principle is labour rather carries to its logical conclusion the denial of man since man himself no longer stands in an external relation of tension to the external substance of private property but has himself become this tense essence of private property"
"What was previously being external to oneself man 's actual externalisation has merely become the act of externalising the process of alienating"
"This political economy begins by seeming to acknowledge man his independence spontaneity etc then locating private property in man 's own being it can no longer be conditioned by the local national or other characteristics of private property as of something existing outside itself"
"This political economy consequently displays a cosmopolitan universal energy which overthrows every restriction and bond so as to establish itself instead as the sole politics the sole universality the sole limit and sole bond"
"Hence it must throw aside this hypocrisy in the course of its further development and come out in its complete cynicism"
"And this it does untroubled by all the apparent contradictions in which it becomes involved as a result of this theory by developing the idea of labour much more one sidedly and therefore more sharply and more consistently as the sole essence of wealth by proving the implications of this theory to be anti human in character in contrast to the other original approach"
"Finally by dealing the death blow to rent that last individual natural mode of private property and source of wealth existing independently of the movement of labour that expression of feudal property an expression which has already become wholly economic in character and therefore incapable of resisting political economy"
"There is not merely a relative growth in the cynicism of political economy from Smith through Say to Ricardo Mill etc inasmuch as the implications of industry appear more developed and more contradictory in the eyes of the last named these later economists also advance in a positive sense constantly and consciously further than their predecessors in their estrangement from man"
"They do so however only because their science develops more consistently and truthfully"
"Because they make private property in its active form the subject thus simultaneously turning man into the essence and at the same time turning man as non essentiality into the essence the contradiction of ||II| reality corresponds completely to the contradictory being which they accept as their principle"
"Far from refuting it the ruptured world of industry confirms their self ruptured principle"
"Their principle is after all the principle of this rupture"
"Physiocracy represents directly the decomposition of feudal property in economic terms but it therefore just as directly represents its economic metamorphosis and restoration save that now its language is no longer feudal but economic"
"All wealth is resolved into land and cultivation agriculture"
"Land is not yet capital it is still a special mode of its existence the validity of which is supposed to lie in and to derive from its natural peculiarity"
"Yet land is a general natural element whilst the mercantile system admits the existence of wealth only in the form of precious metal"
"Thus the object of wealth its matter has straightway obtained the highest degree of universality within the bounds of nature insofar as even as nature it is immediate objective wealth"
"And land only exists for man through labour through agriculture"
"Thus the subjective essence of wealth has already been transferred to labour"
"But at the same time agriculture is the only productive labour"
"Hence labour is not yet grasped in its generality and abstraction it is still bound to a particular natural element as its matter and it is therefore only recognised in a particular mode of existence determined by nature"
"It is therefore still only a specific particular alienation of man just as its product is likewise conceived nearly as a specific form of wealth due more to nature than to labour itself"
"The land is here still recognised as a phenomenon of nature independent of man not yet as capital i.e. as an aspect of labour itself"
"Labour appears rather as an aspect of the land"
"But since the fetishism of the old external wealth of wealth existing only as an object has been reduced to a very simple natural element and since its essence even if only partially and in a particular form has been recognised within its subjective existence the necessary step forward has been made in revealing the general nature of wealth and hence in the raising up of labour in its total absoluteness i.e. its abstraction as the principle"
"It is argued against physiocracy that agriculture from the economic point of view that is to say from the only valid point of view does not differ from any other industry and that the essence of wealth therefore is not a specific form of labour bound to a particular element a particular expression of labour but labour in general"
"Physiocracy denies particular external merely objective wealth by declaring labour to be the essence of wealth"
"But for physiocracy labour is at first only the subjective essence of landed property"
"It takes its departure from the type of property which historically appears as the dominant and acknowledged type"
"It turns only landed property into alienated man"
"It annuls its feudal character by declaring industry agriculture as its essence"
"But it disavows the world of industry and acknowledges the feudal system by declaring agriculture to be the only industry"
"It is clear that if the subjective essence of industry is now grasped of industry in opposition to landed property i.e. of industry constituting itself as industry this essence includes within itself its opposite"
"Just as landed property is the first form of private property with industry at first confronting it historically merely as a special kind of property or rather as landed property 's liberated slave so this process repeats itself in the scientific analysis of the subjective essence of private property labour"
"Labour appears at first only as agricultural labour but then asserts itself as labour in general"
"||III| All wealth has become industrial wealth the wealth of labour and industry is accomplished labour just as the factory system is the perfected essence of industry that is of labour and just as industrial capital is the accomplished objective form of private property"
"We can now see how it is only at this point that private property can complete its dominion over man and become in its most general form a world historical power"
"Preface and Table of Contents | Private Property and Communism Karl Marx Internet Archive"
"This refers to the missing part of the second manuscript"
"It can find expression in this first form even without the advanced development of private property as in ancient Rome Turkey etc"
"But labour the subjective essence of private property as exclusion of property and capital objective labour as exclusion of labour constitute private property as its developed state of contradiction hence a dynamic relationship driving towards resolution"
"Re the same page"
"The transcendence of self estrangement follows the same course as self estrangement"
"Private property is first considered only in its objective aspect but nevertheless with labour as its essence"
"Its form of existence is therefore capital which is to be annulled as such Proudhon"
"Or a particular form of labour labour levelled down fragmented and therefore unfree is conceived as the source of private property ’s perniciousness and of its existence in estrangement from men"
"For instance Fourier who like the Physiocrats also conceives agricultural labour to be at least the exemplary type whereas Saint Simon declares in contrast that industrial labour as such is the essence and accordingly aspires to the exclusive rule of the industrialists and the improvement of the workers condition"
"Finally communism is the positive expression of annulled private property at first as universal private property"
"By embracing this relation as a whole communism is"
"In its first form only a generalisation and consummation of it of this relation"
"It wants to disregard talent etc in an arbitrary manner"
"For it the sole purpose of life and existence is direct physical possession"
"The category of the worker is not done away with but extended to all men"
"The relationship of private property persists as the relationship of the community to the world of things"
"Finally this movement of opposing universal private property to private property finds expression in the brutish form of opposing to marriage certainly a form of exclusive private property the community of women in which a woman becomes a piece of communal and common property"
"Just as woman passes from marriage to general prostitution Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the labourer and since it is a relationship in which falls not the prostitute alone but also the one who prostitutes and the latter ’s abomination is still greater the capitalist etc also comes under this head"
"Note by Marx 31"
"so the entire world of wealth that is of man ’s objective substance passes from the relationship of exclusive marriage with the owner of private property to a state of universal prostitution with the community"
"This type of communism since it negates the personality of man in every sphere is but the logical expression of private property which is this negation"
"General envy constituting itself as a power is the disguise in which greed re establishes itself and satisfies itself only in another way"
"The thought of every piece of private property as such is at least turned against wealthier private property in the form of envy and the urge to reduce things to a common level so that this envy and urge even constitute the essence of competition"
"Crude communism the manuscript has Kommunist"
"is only the culmination of this envy and of this levelling down proceeding from the preconceived minimum"
"It has a definite limited standard"
"How little this annulment of private property is really an appropriation is in fact proved by the abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilisation the regression to the unnatural || IV ||IV| simplicity of the poor and crude man who has few needs and who has not only failed to go beyond private property but has not yet even reached it"
"The community is only a community of labour and equality of wages paid out by communal capital by the community as the universal capitalist"
"Both sides of the relationship are raised to an imagined universality labour as the category in which every person is placed and capital as the acknowledged universality and power of the community"
"In the approach to woman as the spoil and hand maid of communal lust is expressed the infinite degradation in which man exists for himself for the secret of this approach has its unambiguous decisive plain and undisguised expression in the relation of man to woman and in the manner in which the direct and natural species relationship is conceived"
"The direct natural and necessary relation of person to person is the relation of man to woman"
"In this natural species relationship man ’s relation to nature is immediately his relation to man just as his relation to man is immediately his relation to nature his own natural destination"
"In this relationship therefore is sensuously manifested reduced to an observable fact the extent to which the human essence has become nature to man or to which nature to him has become the human essence of man"
"From this relationship one can therefore judge man ’s whole level of development"
"From the character of this relationship follows how much man as a species being as man has come to be himself and to comprehend himself the relation of man to woman is the most natural relation of human being to human being"
"It therefore reveals the extent to which man ’s natural behaviour has become human or the extent to which the human essence in him has become a natural essence the extent to which his human nature has come to be natural to him"
"This relationship also reveals the extent to which man ’s need has become a human need the extent to which therefore the other person as a person has become for him a need the extent to which he in his individual existence is at the same time a social being"
"The first positive annulment of private property crude communism is thus merely a manifestation of the vileness of private property which wants to set itself up as the positive community system"
"2 Communism α still political in nature democratic or despotic β with the abolition of the state yet still incomplete and being still affected by private property i.e. by the estrangement of man"
"In both forms communism already is aware of being reintegration or return of man to himself the transcendence of human self estrangement but since it has not yet grasped the positive essence of private property and just as little the human nature of need it remains captive to it and infected by it"
"It has indeed grasped its concept but not its essence"
"3 Communism as the positive transcendence of private property as human self estrangement and"
"therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social i.e. human being a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development"
"This communism as fully developed naturalism equals humanism and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence between objectification and self confirmation between freedom and necessity between the individual and the species"
"Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution"
"The entire movement of history just as its communism ’s actual act of genesis the birth act of its empirical existence is therefore for its thinking consciousness the comprehended and known process of its becoming"
"Whereas the still immature communism seeks an historical proof for itself a proof in the realm of what already exists among disconnected historical phenomena opposed to private property tearing single phases from the historical process and focusing attention on them as proofs of its historical pedigree a hobby horse ridden hard especially by Cabet Villegardelle etc"
"By so doing it simply makes clear that by far the greater part of this process contradicts its own claim and that if it has ever existed precisely its being in the past refutes its pretension to reality"
"It is easy to see that the entire revolutionary movement necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of private property more precisely in that of the economy"
"This material immediately perceptible private property is the material perceptible expression of estranged human life"
"Its movement production and consumption is the perceptible revelation of the movement of all production until now i.e. the realisation or the reality of man"
"Religion family state law morality science art etc are only particular modes of production and fall under its general law"
"The positive transcendence of private property as the appropriation of human life is therefore the positive transcendence of all estrangement that is to say the return of man from religion family state etc to his human i.e. social existence"
"Religious estrangement as such occurs only in the realm of consciousness of man ’s inner life but economic estrangement is that of real life its transcendence therefore embraces both aspects"
"It is evident that the initial stage of the movement amongst the various peoples depends on whether the true recognised life of the people manifests itself more in consciousness or in the external world is more ideal or real"
"Communism begins from the outset Owen with atheism but atheism is at first far from being communism indeed that atheism is still mostly an abstraction"
"We have seen how on the assumption of positively annulled private property man produces man himself and the other man how the object being the direct manifestation of his individuality is simultaneously his own existence for the other man the existence of the other man and that existence for him"
"Likewise however both the material of labour and man as the subject are the point of departure as well as the result of the movement and precisely in this fact that they must constitute the point of departure lies the historical necessity of private property"
"Thus the social character is the general character of the whole movement just as society itself produces man as man so is society produced by him"
"Activity and enjoyment both in their content and in their mode of existence are social social activity and social enjoyment"
"The human aspect of nature exists only for social man for only then does nature exist for him as a bond with man as his existence for the other and the other"
"’s existence for him and as the life element of human reality"
"Only here has what is to him"
"Thus society is the complete unity of man with nature the true resurrection of nature the consistent naturalism of man and the consistent humanism of nature"
"But also when I am active scientifically etc an activity which I can seldom perform in direct community with others then my activity is social because I perform it as a man"
"Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product as is even the language in which the thinker is active my own existence is social activity and therefore that which I make of myself I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being"
"The activity of my general consciousness as an activity is therefore also my theoretical existence as a social being"
"Above all we must avoid postulating society again as an abstraction vis à vis the individual"
"The individual is the social being"
"His manifestations of life even if they may not appear in the direct form of communal manifestations of life carried out in association with others are therefore an expression and confirmation of social life"
"Man ’s individual and species life are not different however much and this is inevitable the mode of existence of the individual is a more particular or more general mode of the life of the species or the life of the species is a more particular or more general individual life"
"Thinking and being are thus certainly distinct but at the same time they are in unity with each other"
"Death seems to be a harsh victory of the species over the particular individual and to contradict their unity"
"But the particular individual is only a particular species being and as such mortal"
"< 4 In the manuscript 5"
"Just as private property is only the perceptible expression of the fact that man becomes objective for himself and at the same time becomes to himself a strange and inhuman object just as it expresses the fact that the manifestation of his life is the alienation of his life that his realisation is his loss of reality is an alien reality"
"so the positive transcendence of private property i.e. the perceptible appropriation for and by man of the human essence and of human life of objective man of human achievements should not be conceived merely in the sense of immediate one sided enjoyment merely in the sense of possessing of having"
"Each of his human relations to the world seeing hearing smelling tasting feeling thinking observing experiencing wanting acting loving in short all the organs of his individual being like those organs which are directly social in their form ||VII| are in their objective orientation or in their orientation to the object the appropriation of the object the appropriation of human reality"
"Their orientation to the object is the manifestation of the human reality For this reason it is just as highly varied as the determinations of human essence and activities"
"it is human activity and human suffering for suffering humanly considered is a kind of self enjoyment of man"
"Private property has made us so stupid and one sided that an object is only ours when we have it when it exists for us as capital or when it is directly possessed eaten drunk worn inhabited etc in short when it is used by us"
"Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realisations of possession only as means of life and the life which they serve as means is the life of private property labour and conversion into capital"
"In the place of all physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of all these senses the sense of having"
"The human being had to be reduced to this absolute poverty in order that he might yield his inner wealth to the outer world"
"On the category of having see Hess in the Philosophy of the Deed"
"The abolition Aufhebung of private property is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and qualities but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become subjectively and objectively human"
"The eye has become a human eye just as its object has become a social human object an object made by man for man"
"They relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man In practice I can relate myself to a thing humanly only if the thing relates itself humanly to the human being"
"Note by Marx and vice versa"
"Need or enjoyment have consequently lost its egotistical nature and nature has lost its mere utility by use becoming human use"
"In the same way the senses and enjoyment of other men have become my own appropriation"
"Besides these direct organs therefore social organs develop in the form of society thus for instance activity in direct association with others etc has become an organ for expressing my own life and a mode of appropriating human life"
"It is obvious that the human eye enjoys things in a way different from the crude non human eye the human ear different from the crude ear etc"
"We have seen that man does not lose himself in his object only when the object becomes for him a human object or objective man"
"This is possible only when the object becomes for him a social object he himself for himself a social being just as society becomes a being for him in this object"
"On the one hand therefore it is only when the objective world becomes everywhere for man in society the world of man ’s essential powers human reality and for that reason the reality of his own essential powers that all objects become for him the objectification of himself become objects which confirm and realise his individuality become his objects that is man himself becomes the object"
"The manner in which they become his depends on the nature of the objects and on the nature of the essential power corresponding to it for it is precisely the determinate nature of this relationship which shapes the particular real mode of affirmation"
"To the eye an object comes to be other than it is to the ear and the object of the eye is another object than the object of the ear"
"The specific character of each essential power is precisely its specific essence and therefore also the specific mode of its objectification of its objectively actual living being"
"Thus man is affirmed in the objective world not only in the act of thinking ||VIII| but with all his senses"
"On the other hand let us look at this in its subjective aspect"
"Just as only music awakens in man the sense of music and just as the most beautiful music has no sense for the unmusical ear is no object for it because my object can only be the confirmation of one of my essential powers it can therefore only exist for me insofar as my essential power exists for itself as a subjective capacity because the meaning of an object for me goes only so far as my sense goes has only a meaning for a sense corresponding to that object for this reason the senses of the social man differ from those of the non social man"
"Only through the objectively unfolded richness of man ’s essential being is the richness of subjective human sensibility a musical ear an eye for beauty of form in short senses capable of human gratification senses affirming themselves as essential powers of man either cultivated or brought into being"
"For not only the five senses but also the so called mental senses the practical senses will love etc in a word human sense the human nature of the senses comes to be by virtue of its object by virtue of humanised nature"
"The sense caught up in crude practical need has only a restricted sense"
"For the starving man it is not the human form of food that exists but only its abstract existence as food"
"It could just as well be there in its crudest form and it would be impossible to say wherein this feeding activity differs from that of animals"
"The care burdened poverty stricken man has no sense for the finest play the dealer in minerals sees only the commercial value but not the beauty and the specific character of the mineral he has no mineralogical sense"
"Thus the objectification of the human essence both in its theoretical and practical aspects is required to make man ’s sense human as well as to create the human sense corresponding to the entire wealth of human and natural substance"
"< Just as through the movement of private property of its wealth as well as its poverty of its material and spiritual wealth and poverty the budding society finds at hand all the material for this development so established society produces man in this entire richness of his being"
"produces the rich man profoundly endowed with all the senses as its enduring reality"
"We see how subjectivity and objectivity spirituality and materiality activity and suffering lose their antithetical character and thus their existence as such antitheses only within the framework of society < we see how the resolution of the theoretical antitheses is only possible in a practical way by virtue of the practical energy of man"
"We see how the history of industry and the established objective existence of industry are the open book of man ’s essential powers the perceptibly existing human psychology"
"this was not conceived in its connection with man ’s essential being but only in an external relation of utility because moving in the realm of estrangement people could only think of man ’s general mode of being religion or history in its abstract general character as politics art literature etc"
"We have before us the objectified essential powers of man in the form of sensuous alien useful objects in the form of estrangement displayed in ordinary material industry which can be conceived either as a part of that general movement or that movement can be conceived as a particular part of industry since all human activity hitherto has been labour that is industry"
"activity estranged from itself"
"A psychology for which this book the part of history existing in the most perceptible and accessible form remains a closed book can not become a genuine comprehensive and real science"
"What indeed are we to think of a science which airily abstracts from this large part of human labour and which fails to feel its own incompleteness while such a wealth of human endeavour unfolded before it means nothing more to it than perhaps what can be expressed in one word need vulgar need"
"Philosophy however has remained just as alien to them as they remain to philosophy"
"The will was there but the power was lacking"
"Historiography itself pays regard to natural science only occasionally as a factor of enlightenment utility and of some special great discoveries"
"But natural science has invaded and transformed human life all the more practically through the medium of industry and has prepared human emancipation although its immediate effect had to be the furthering of the dehumanisation of man"
"If therefore industry is conceived as the exoteric revelation of man ’s essential powers we also gain an understanding of the human essence of nature or the natural essence of man"
"In consequence natural science will lose its abstractly material or rather its idealistic tendency and will become the basis of human science as it has already become albeit in an estranged form the basis of actual human life and to assume one basis for life and a different basis for science is as a matter of course a lie"
"The nature which develops in human history the genesis of human society is man ’s real nature hence nature as it develops through industry even though in an estranged form is true anthropological nature"
"Sense perception see Feuerbach must be the basis of all science"
"All history is the history of preparing and developing man to become the object of sensuous consciousness and turning the requirements of man as man into his needs"
"History itself is a real part of natural history of nature developing into man"
"Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science there will be one science"
"||X| Man is the immediate object of natural science for immediate sensuous nature for man is immediately human sensuousness the expressions are identical presented immediately in the form of the other man sensuously present for him"
"Indeed his own sense perception first exists as human sensuousness for himself through the other man"
"The element of thought itself the element of thought ’s living expression language is of a sensuous nature"
"The social reality of nature and human natural science or the natural science of man are identical terms"
"< It will be seen how in place of the wealth and poverty of political economy come the rich human being and the rich human need"
"The rich human being is simultaneously the human being in need of a totality of human manifestations of life the man in whom his own realisation exists as an inner necessity as need"
"Not only wealth but likewise the poverty of man under the assumption of socialism[32 receives in equal measure a human and therefore social significance"
"Poverty is the passive bond which causes the human being to experience the need of the greatest wealth the other human being"
"The dominion of the objective being in me the sensuous outburst of my life activity is passion which thus becomes here the activity of my being"
"A being only considers himself independent when he stands on his own feet and he only stands on his own feet when he owes his existence to himself"
"A man who lives by the grace of another regards himself as a dependent being"
"But I live completely by the grace of another if I owe him not only the maintenance of my life but if he has moreover created my life if he is the source of my life"
"When it is not of my own creation my life has necessarily a source of this kind outside of it"
"The Creation is therefore an idea very difficult to dislodge from popular consciousness"
"The fact that nature and man exist on their own account is incomprehensible to it because it contradicts everything tangible in practical life"
"The creation of the earth has received a mighty blow from geognosy i.e. from the science which presents the formation of the earth the development of the earth as a process as a self generation"
"Generatio aequivoca is the only practical refutation of the theory of creation.[33"
"Now it is certainly easy to say to the single individual what Aristotle has already said You have been begotten by your father and your mother therefore in you the mating of two human beings a species act of human beings has produced the human being"
"Therefore you must not only keep sight of the one aspect the infinite progression which leads you further to inquire"
"Who begot my father"
"You must also hold on to the circular movement sensuously perceptible in that progress by which man repeats himself in procreation man thus always remaining the subject"
"You will reply however I grant you this circular movement now grant me the progress which drives me ever further until I ask Who begot the first man and nature as a whole"
"I can only answer you Your question is itself a product of abstraction"
"Ask yourself how you arrived at that question"
"Ask yourself whether your question is not posed from a standpoint to which I can not reply because it is wrongly put"
"Ask yourself whether that progress as such exists for a reasonable mind"
"When you ask about the creation of nature and man you are abstracting in so doing from man and nature"
"You postulate them as non existent and yet you want me to prove them to you as existing"
"Now I say to you Give up your abstraction and you will also give up your question"
"Or if you want to hold on to your abstraction then be consistent and if you think of man and nature as non existent ||XI| then think of yourself as non existent for you too are surely nature and man"
"Do n’t think do n’t ask me for as soon as you think and ask your abstraction from the existence of nature and man has no meaning"
"Or are you such an egotist that you conceive everything as nothing and yet want yourself to exist"
"I do not want to postulate the nothingness of nature etc"
"I ask you about its genesis just as I ask the anatomist about the formation of bones etc"
"But since for the socialist man the entire so called history of the world is nothing but the creation of man through human labour nothing but the emergence of nature for man so he has the visible irrefutable proof of his birth through himself of his genesis"
"Since the real existence of man and nature has become evident in practice through sense experience because man has thus become evident for man as the being of nature and nature for man as the being of man the question about an alien being about a being above nature and man a question which implies the admission of the unreality of nature and of man has become impossible in practice"
"Atheism as the denial of this unreality has no longer any meaning for atheism is a negation of God and postulates the existence of man through this negation but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation"
"It proceeds from the theoretically and practically sensuous consciousness of man and of nature as the essence"
"Socialism is man ’s positive self consciousness no longer mediated through the abolition of religion just as real life is man ’s positive reality no longer mediated through the abolition of private property through communism"
"Communism is the position as the negation of the negation and is hence the actual phase necessary for the next stage of historical development in the process of human emancipation and rehabilitation"
"Communism is the necessary form and the dynamic principle of the immediate future but communism as such is not the goal of human development the form of human society.|XI||[34"
"Preface and Table of Contents | Human Needs and Division of Labour Marx Engels Archive"
"We have seen what significance given socialism the wealth of human needs acquires and what significance therefore both a new mode of production and a new object of production obtain a new manifestation of the forces of human nature and a new enrichment of human nature"
"Under private property their significance is reversed every person speculates on creating a new need in another so as to drive him to fresh sacrifice to place him in a new dependence and to seduce him into a new mode of enjoyment and therefore economic ruin"
"Each tries to establish over the other an alien power so as thereby to find satisfaction of his own selfish need"
"The increase in the quantity of objects is therefore accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected and every new product represents a new potentiality of mutual swindling and mutual plundering"
"Man becomes ever poorer as man his need for money becomes ever greater if he wants to master the hostile power"
"The power of his money declines in inverse proportion to the increase in the volume of production that is his neediness grows as the power of money increases"
"The need for money is therefore the true need produced by the economic system and it is the only need which the latter produces"
"The quantity of money becomes to an ever greater degree its sole effective quality"
"Just as it reduces everything to its abstract form so it reduces itself in the course of its own movement to quantitative being"
"Excess and intemperance come to be its true norm"
"Private property does not know how to change crude need into human need"
"Its idealism is fantasy caprice and whim and no eunuch flatters his despot more basely or uses more despicable means to stimulate his dulled capacity for pleasure in order to sneak a favour for himself than does the industrial eunuch the producer in order to sneak for himself a few pieces of silver in order to charm the golden birds out of the pockets of his dearly beloved neighbours in Christ"
"He puts himself at the service of the other ’s most depraved fancies plays the pimp between him and his need excites in him morbid appetites lies in wait for each of his weaknesses all so that he can then demand the cash for this service of love"
"Every product is a bait with which to seduce away the other ’s very being his money every real and possible need is a weakness which will lead the fly to the glue pot"
"General exploitation of communal human nature just as every imperfection in man is a bond with heaven an avenue giving the priest access to his heart every need is an opportunity to approach one ’s neighbour under the guise of the utmost amiability and to say to him"
"Dear friend I give you what you need but you know the conditio sine qua non you know the ink in which you have to sign yourself over to me in providing for your pleasure I fleece you"
"This estrangement manifests itself in part in that the sophistication of needs and of the means of their satisfaction on the one side produces a bestial barbarisation a complete crude abstract simplicity of need on the other or rather in that it merely reproduces itself in its opposite"
"For this mortuary he has to pay"
"A dwelling in the light which Prometheus in Aeschylus designated as one of the greatest boons by means of which he made the savage into a human being ceases to exist for the worker"
"Light air etc the simplest animal cleanliness ceases to be a need for man"
"Filth this stagnation and putrefaction of man the sewage of civilisation speaking quite literally comes to be the element of life for him"
"Utter unnatural depravation putrefied nature comes to be his life element"
"None of his senses exist any longer and each has ceased to function not only in its human fashion but in an inhuman fashion so that it does not exist even in an animal fashion"
"The crudest methods and instruments of human labour are coming back the treadmill of the Roman slaves for instance is the means of production the means of existence of many English workers"
"It is not only that man has no human needs"
"The Irishman no longer knows any need now but the need to eat and indeed only the need to eat potatoes and scabby potatoes at that the worst kind of potatoes"
"But in each of their industrial towns England and France have already a little Ireland"
"The savage and the animal have at least the need to hunt to roam etc"
"the need of companionship"
"The simplification of the machine of labour is used to make a worker out of the human being still in the making the completely immature human being the child whilst the worker has become a neglected child"
"The machine accommodates itself to the weakness of the human being in order to make the weak human being into a machine"
"1 By reducing the worker ’s need to the barest and most miserable level of physical subsistence and by reducing his activity to the most abstract mechanical movement thus he says Man has no other need either of activity or of enjoyment"
"For he declares that this life too is human life and existence"
"By counting the most meagre form of life existence as the standard indeed as the general standard general because it is applicable to the mass of men"
"He turns the worker into an insensible being lacking all needs just as he changes his activity into a pure abstraction from all activity"
"Political economy this science of wealth is therefore simultaneously the science of renunciation of want of saving and it actually reaches the point where it spares man the need of either fresh air or physical exercise"
"This science of marvellous industry is simultaneously the science of asceticism and its true ideal is the ascetic but extortionate miser and the ascetic but productive slave"
"it has been presented bathed in sentimentality on the stage"
"Thus political economy despite its worldly and voluptuous appearance is a true moral science the most moral of all the sciences"
"Self renunciation the renunciation of life and of all human needs is its principal thesis"
"The less you eat drink and buy books the less you go to the theatre the dance hall the public house the less you think love theorise sing paint fence etc"
"the more you save the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor rust will devour your capital"
"Everything ||XVI| which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity"
"he replaces for you in money and in wealth and all the things which you can not do your money can do"
"Yet being all this it wants to do nothing but create itself buy itself for everything else is after all its servant and when I have the master I have the servant and do not need his servant"
"All passions and all activity must therefore be submerged in avarice"
"The worker may only have enough for him to want to live and may only want to live in order to have that"
"It is true that a controversy now arises in the field of political economy"
"The one side Lauderdale Malthus etc recommends luxury and execrates thrift"
"The other Say Ricardo etc recommends thrift and execrates luxury"
"But the former admits that it wants luxury in order to produce labour i.e. absolute thrift and the latter admits that it recommends thrift in order to produce wealth i.e. luxury"
"The Lauderdale Malthus school has the romantic notion that avarice alone ought not to determine the consumption of the rich and it contradicts its own laws in advancing extravagance as a direct means of enrichment"
"Against it therefore the other side very earnestly and circumstantially proves that I do not increase but reduce my possessions by being extravagant"
"The Say Ricardo school is hypocritical in not admitting that it is precisely whim and caprice which determine production"
"It forgets the refined needs it forgets that there would be no production without consumption it forgets that as a result of competition production can only become more extensive and luxurious"
"It forgets that according to its views a thing ’s value is determined by use and that use is determined by fashion"
"It wishes to see only useful things produced but it forgets that production of too many useful things produces too large a useless population"
"Both sides forget that extravagance and thrift luxury and privation wealth and poverty are equal"
"And you must not only stint the gratification of your immediate senses as by stinting yourself on food"
"you must also spare yourself all sharing of general interests all sympathy all trust etc if you want to be economical if you do not want to be ruined by illusions"
"< You must make everything that is yours saleable i.e. useful"
"If I ask the political economist Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale by surrendering it to another ’s lust"
"Or am I not acting in keeping with political economy if I sell my friend to the Moroccans"
"And the direct sale of men in the form of a trade in conscripts etc takes place in all civilised countries"
"Then the political economist replies to me You do not transgress my laws but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it"
"My political economic ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with but"
"But whom am I now to believe political economy or ethics"
"And how can I have a good conscience if I do not know anything"
"It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yardstick ethics one and political economy another for each is a specific estrangement of man and"
"> ||XVII| focuses attention on a particular field of estranged essential activity and each stands in an estranged relation to the other"
"Thus M. Michel Chevalier reproaches Ricardo with having ignored ethics"
"But Ricardo is allowing political economy to speak its own language and if it does not speak ethically this is not Ricardo ’s fault"
"M. Chevalier takes no account of political economy insofar as he moralises but he really and necessarily ignores ethics insofar as he practises political economy"
"The relationship of political economy to ethics if it is other than an arbitrary contingent and therefore unfounded and unscientific relationship if it is not being posited for the sake of appearance but is meant to be essential can only be the relationship of the laws of political economy to ethics"
"If there is no such connection or if the contrary is rather the case can Ricardo help it"
"Moreover the opposition between political economy and ethics is only an apparent opposition and just as much no opposition as it is an opposition"
"All that happens is that political economy expresses moral laws in its own way"
"< Frugality as the principle of political economy is most brilliantly shown in its theory of population"
"Even the existence of men is a pure luxury and if the worker is ethical he will be sparing in procreation"
"Mill suggests public acclaim for those who prove themselves continent in their sexual relations and public rebuke for those who sin against such barrenness of marriage"
"Is this not ethics the teaching of asceticism"
"The production of people appears as public destitution"
"The meaning which production has in relation to the rich is seen revealed in the meaning which it has for the poor"
"Looking upwards the manifestation is always refined veiled ambiguous outward appearance downwards it is rough straightforward frank the real thing"
"The worker ’s crude need is a far greater source of gain than the refined need of the rich"
"The English gin shops are therefore the symbolical representations of private property"
"Their luxury reveals the true relation of industrial luxury and wealth to man"
"They are therefore rightly the only Sunday pleasures of the people which the English police treats at least mildly.|XVII||"
"We have already seen how the political economist establishes the unity of labour and capital in a variety of ways"
"1 Capital is accumulated labour"
"The purpose of capital within production partly reproduction of capital with profit partly capital as raw material material of labour and partly as an automatically working instrument the machine is capital directly equated with labour is productive labour"
"The worker is a capital"
"In relation to the capitalist labour is an aspect of his capital ’s activity"
"Finally 7 the political economist postulates the original unity of capital and labour as the unity of the capitalist and the worker this is the original state of paradise"
"The way in which these two aspects ||XIX| as two persons confront each other is for the political economist an accidental event and hence only to be explained by reference to external factors"
"The nations which are still dazzled by the sensuous glitter of precious metals and are therefore still fetish worshippers of metal money are not yet fully developed money nations"
"Contrast of France and England"
"The extent to which the solution of theoretical riddles is the task of practice and effected through practice the extent to which true practice is the condition of a real and positive theory is shown for example in fetishism"
"The sensuous consciousness of the fetish worshipper is different from that of the Greek because his sensuous existence is different"
"The abstract enmity between sense and spirit is necessary so long as the human feeling for nature the human sense of nature and therefore also the natural sense of man are not yet produced by man ’s own labour"
"Equality is nothing but a translation of the German Ich = Ich 37 into the French i.e. political form"
"Naturally the transcendence of the estrangement always proceeds from that form of the estrangement which is the dominant power"
"in Germany self consciousness in France equality because it is politics in England real material practical need taking only itself as its standard"
"It is from this standpoint that Proudhon is to be criticised and appreciated"
"If we characterise communism itself because of its character as negation of the negation as the appropriation of the human essence through the intermediary of the negation of private property as being not yet the true self originating position but rather a position originating from private property in old German fashion in the way of Hegel ’s phenomenology finished as a conquered moment and"
"one might be satisfied by it in his consciousness of the human being only by real"
"transcendence of his thought now as before since with him therefore the real estrangement of the life of man remains and remains all the more the more one is conscious of it as such hence it the negation of this estrangement can be accomplished solely by bringing about communism"
"In order to abolish the idea of private property the idea of communism is quite sufficient"
"It takes actual communist action to abolish actual private property"
"History will lead to it and this movement which in theory we already know to be a self transcending movement will constitute in actual fact a very rough and protracted process"
"But we must regard it as a real advance to have at the outset gained a consciousness of the limited character as well as of the goal of this historical movement and a consciousness which reaches out beyond it"
"When communist artisans associate with one another theory propaganda etc is their first end"
"But at the same time as a result of this association they acquire a new need the need for society and what appears as a means becomes an end"
"Such things as smoking drinking eating etc are no longer means of contact or means that bring them together"
"When political economy claims that demand and supply always balance each other it immediately forgets that according to its own claim theory of population the supply of people always exceeds the demand and that therefore in the essential result of the whole production process the existence of man the disparity between demand and supply gets its most striking expression"
"The extent to which money which appears as a means constitutes true power and the sole end the extent to which in general the means which turns me into a being which gives me possession of the alien objective being is an end in itself"
"can be clearly seen from the fact that landed property wherever land is the source of life and horse and sword wherever these are the true means of life are also acknowledged as the true political powers in life"
"In the Middle Ages a social estate is emancipated as soon as it is allowed to carry the sword"
"Amongst nomadic peoples it is the horse which makes me a free man and a participant in the life of the community"
"We have said above that man is regressing to the cave dwelling etc"
"but he is regressing to it in an estranged malignant form"
"The savage in his cave a natural element which freely offers itself for his use and protection feels himself no more a stranger or rather feels as much at home as a fish in water"
"But the cellar dwelling of the poor man is a hostile element a dwelling which remains an alien power and only gives itself up to him insofar as he gives up to it his own blood and sweat a dwelling which he can not regard as his own hearth where he might at last exclaim Here I am at home but where instead he finds himself in someone else ’s house in the house of a stranger who always watches him and throws him out if he does not pay his rent"
"He is also aware of the contrast in quality between his dwelling and a human dwelling that stands in the other world in the heaven of wealth"
"Estrangement is manifested not only in the fact that my means of life belong to someone else that which I desire is the inaccessible possession of another but also in the fact that everything is itself something different from itself that my activity is something else and that finally and this applies also to the capitalist all is under the sway of inhuman power"
"There is a form of inactive extravagant wealth given over wholly to pleasure the enjoyer of which on the one hand behaves as a mere ephemeral individual frantically spending himself to no purpose and also regards the slave labour of others human sweat and blood as the prey of his cupidity"
"He therefore knows man himself and hence also his own self as a sacrificed and futile being"
"With such wealth contempt of man makes its appearance partly as arrogance and as squandering of what can give sustenance to a hundred human lives and partly as the infamous illusion that his own unbridled extravagance and ceaseless unproductive consumption is the condition of the other ’s labour and therefore of his subsistence"
"He regards the realisation of the essential powers of man only as the realisation of his own excesses his whims and capricious bizarre notions"
"This ||XXI| and the glittering illusion about the nature of wealth blinded by sensuous appearances is confronted by the working sober prosaic economical industrialist who is quite enlightened about the nature of wealth and who while providing a wider sphere for the other ’s self indulgence and paying fulsome flatteries to him in his products for his products are just so many base compliments to the appetites of the spendthrift knows how to appropriate for himself in the only useful way the other ’s waning power"
"If therefore industrial wealth appears at first to be the result of extravagant fantastic wealth yet its motion the motion inherent in it ousts the latter also in an active way"
"For the fall in the rate of interest is a necessary consequence and result of industrial development"
"The extravagant rentier ’s means therefore dwindle day by day in inverse proportion to the increasing possibilities and pitfalls of pleasure"
"Consequently he must either consume his capital thus ruining himself or must become an industrial capitalist"
"In the other hand there is a direct constant rise in the rent of land as a result of the course of industrial development nevertheless as we have already seen there must come a time when landed property like every other kind of property is bound to fall within the category of profitably self reproducing capital and this in fact results from the same industrial development"
"Thus the squandering landowner too must either consume his capital and thus be ruined or himself become the farmer of his own estate an agricultural industrialist"
"It is a total victory of private property over all those of its qualities which are still in appearance human and the complete subjection of the owner of private property to the essence of private property labour"
"To be sure the industrial capitalist also takes his pleasures"
"He does not by any means return to the unnatural simplicity of need but his pleasure is only a side issue recreation something subordinated to production at the same time it is a calculated and therefore itself an economical pleasure"
"For he debits it to his capital ’s expense account and what is squandered on his pleasure must therefore amount to no more than will be replaced with profit through the reproduction of capital"
"Pleasure is therefore subsumed under capital and the pleasure taking individual under the capital accumulating individual whilst formerly the contrary was the case"
"This is indeed the only way in which that which exists affirms its opposite"
"The quarrel between the political economists about luxury and thrift is therefore only the quarrel between that political economy which has achieved clarity about the nature of wealth and that political economy which is still afflicted with romantic anti industrial memories"
"Neither side however knows how to reduce the subject of the controversy to its simple terms and neither therefore can make short work of the other.|XXI||"
"Moreover rent of land qua rent of land has been overthrown since contrary to the argument of the Physiocrats which maintains that the landowner is the only true producer modern political economy has proved that the landowner as such is rather the only completely unproductive rentier"
"According to this theory agriculture is the business of the capitalist who invests his capital in it provided he can expect the usual profit"
"The claim of the Physiocrats that landed property as the sole productive property should alone pay state taxes and therefore should alone approve them and participate in the affairs of state is transformed into the opposite position that the tax on the rent of land is the only tax on unproductive income and is therefore the only tax not detrimental to national production"
"It goes without saying that from this point of view also the political privilege of landowners no longer follows from their position as principal tax payers"
"Everything which Proudhon conceives as a movement of labour against capital is only the movement of labour in the determination of capital of industrial capital against capital not consumed as capital i.e. not consumed industrially"
"It is clear therefore that only when labour is grasped as the essence of private property can the economic process as such be analysed in its real concreteness"
"Society as it appears to the political economist is civil society 39 in which every individual is a totality of needs and only ||XXXV| exists for the other person as the other exists for him insofar as each becomes a means for the other"
"The political economist reduces everything just as does politics in its Rights of Man to man i.e. to the individual whom he strips of all determinateness so as to class him as capitalist or worker"
"The division of labour is the economic expression of the social character of labour within the estrangement"
"Or since labour is only an expression of human activity within alienation of the manifestation of life as the alienation of life the division of labour too is therefore nothing else but the estranged alienated positing of human activity as a real activity of the species or as activity of man as a species being"
"As for the essence of the division of labour and of course the division of labour had to be conceived as a major driving force in the production of wealth as soon as labour was recognised as the essence of private property"
"i.e. as for the estranged and alienated form of human activity as an activity of the species the political economists are very vague and self contradictory about it"
"This propensity to trade is probably a -necessary consequence of the use of reason and of speech"
"It is common to all men and to be found in no other race of animals"
"The animal when it is grown up is entirely independent"
"Man has almost constant occasion for the help of others and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only"
"He will be more likely to prevail if he can appeal to their personal interest and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them"
"We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self love and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages"
"As it is by treaty by barter and by purchase that we obtain from one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives occasion to the division of labour"
"He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison with his companions and he finds at last that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison than if he himself went to the field to catch them"
"From a regard to his own interest therefore the making of bows etc grows to be his chief business"
"The difference of natural talents in different men is not"
"so much the cause as the effect of the division of labour"
"Without the disposition to truck and exchange every man must have procured to himself every necessary and conveniency of life"
"All must have had"
"the same work to do and there could have been no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference of talents"
"As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents among men so it is this same disposition which renders that difference useful"
"Many tribes of animals 1 of the same species derive from nature a much more remarkable distinction of genius than what antecedent to custom and education appears to take place among men"
"By nature a philosopher is not in talent and in intelligence half so different from a street porter as a mastiff is from a greyhound or a greyhound from a spaniel or this last from a shepherd ’s dog"
"Those different tribes of animals however though all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another"
"The mastiff can not add to the advantages of his strength ||XXXVI| by making use of the swiftness of the greyhound etc"
"The effects of these different talents or grades of intelligence for want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange can not be brought into a common stock and do not in the least contribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of the species"
"Each animal is still obliged to support and defend itself separately and independently and derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which nature has distinguished its fellows"
"Among men on the contrary the most dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another the different produces of their respective talents by the general disposition to truck barter and exchange being brought as it were into a common stock where every man may purchase whatever part of the produce of other men ’s industry he has occasion for"
"As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power or in other words by the extent of the market"
"When the market is very small no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour which is over and above his own consumption for such parts of the produce of other men ’s labour as he has occasion for"
"In an advanced state of society every man thus lives by exchanging and becomes in some measure a merchant and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society"
"See Destutt de Tracy"
"68 and 78 Society is a series of reciprocal exchanges commerce contains the whole essence of society"
"So much for Adam Smith"
"If every family produced all that it consumed society could keep going although no exchange of any sort took place without being fundamental exchange is indispensable in our advanced state of society"
"The division of labour is a skilful deployment of man ’s powers it increases society ’s"
"production its power and its pleasures but it curtails reduces the ability of every person taken individually"
"Production can not take place without exchange"
"Thus J. B. Say"
"The powers inherent in man are his intelligence and his physical capacity for work"
"Those which arise from the condition of society consist of the capacity to divide up labour and to distribute different jobs amongst different People and the power to exchange mutual services and the products which constitute these means"
"The motive which impels a man to give his services to another is self -interest-"
"he requires a reward for the services rendered"
"The right of exclusive private property is indispensable to the establishment of exchange amongst men"
"Exchange and division of labour reciprocally condition each other"
"Mill presents developed exchange trade as a consequence of the division of labour"
"The agency of man can be traced to very simple elements"
"He can move things towards one another and he can separate them from one another ||XXXVII| the properties of matter perform all the rest"
"In the employment of labour and machinery it is often found that the effects can be increased by skilful distribution by separating all those operations which have any tendency to impede one another and by bringing together all those operations which can be made in any way to aid one another"
"As men in general can not perform many different operations with the same quickness and dexterity with which they can by practice learn to perform a few it is always an advantage to limit as much as possible the number of operations imposed upon each"
"For dividing labour and distributing the powers of men and machinery to the greatest advantage it is in most cases necessary to operate upon a large scale in other words to produce the commodities in greater masses"
"It is this advantage which gives existence to the great manufactories a few of which placed in the most convenient situations frequently supply not one country but many countries with as much as they desire of the commodity produced"
"The whole of modern political economy agrees however that division of labour and wealth of production division of labour and accumulation of capital mutually determine each other just as it agrees that only private property which is at liberty to follow its own course can produce the most useful and comprehensive division of labour"
"Adam Smith ’s argument can be summarised as follows"
"Division of labour bestows on labour infinite productive capacity"
"It stems from the propensity to exchange and barter a specifically human propensity which is probably not accidental but is conditioned by the use of reason and speech"
"The motive of those who engage in exchange is not humanity but egoism"
"The diversity of human talents is more the effect than the cause of the division of labour i.e. of exchange"
"Besides it is only the latter which makes such diversity useful"
"The particular attributes of the different breeds within a species of animal are by nature much more marked than the degrees of difference in human aptitude and activity"
"But because animals are unable to engage in exchange no individual animal benefits from the difference in the attributes of animals of the same species but of different breeds"
"Animals are unable to combine the different attributes of their species and are unable to contribute anything to the common advantage and comfort of the species"
"It is otherwise with men amongst whom the most dissimilar talents and forms of activity are of use to one another because they can bring their different products together into a common stock from which each can purchase"
"As the division of labour springs from the propensity to exchange so it grows and is limited by the extent of exchange by the extent of the market"
"In advanced conditions every man is a merchant and society is a commercial society"
"Say regards exchange as accidental and not fundamental"
"Society could exist without it"
"It becomes indispensable in the advanced state of society"
"Yet production can not take place without it"
"Division of labour is a convenient useful means a skilful deployment of human powers for social wealth but it reduces the ability of each person taken individually"
"The last remark is a step forward on the part of Say"
"Skarbek distinguishes the individual powers inherent in man intelligence and the physical capacity for work from the powers derived from society exchange and division of labour which mutually condition one another"
"But the necessary premise of exchange is private property"
"Mill presents trade as the consequence of the division of labour"
"With him human activity is reduced to mechanical motion"
"Division of labour and use of machinery promote wealth of production"
"Each person must be entrusted with as small a sphere of operations as possible"
"Division of labour and use of machinery in their turn imply large scale production of wealth and hence of products"
"The examination of division of labour and exchange is of extreme interest because these are perceptibly alienated expressions of human activity and essential power as a species activity and species power"
"To assert that division of labour and exchange rest on private property is nothing but asserting that labour is the essence of private property an assertion which the political economist can not prove and which we wish to prove for him"
"Precisely in the fact that division of labour and exchange are aspects of private property lies the twofold proof on the one hand that human life required private property for its realisation and on the other hand that it now requires the supersession of private property"
"Division of labour and exchange are the two phenomena which lead the political economist to boast of the social character of his science while in the same breath he gives unconscious expression to the contradiction in his science the motivation of society by unsocial particular interests"
"Firstly the propensity to exchange the basis of which is found in egoism is regarded as the cause or reciprocal effect of the division of labour"
"Say regards exchange as not fundamental to the nature of society"
"Wealth production is explained by division of labour and exchange"
"The impoverishment of individual activity and its loss of character as a result of the division of labour are admitted"
"Exchange and division of labour are acknowledged as the sources of the great diversity of human talents a diversity which in its turn becomes useful as a result of exchange"
"Skarbek divides man ’s essential powers of production or productive powers into two parts 1 those which are individual and inherent in him his intelligence and his special disposition or capacity for work and 2 those derived from society and not from the actual individual division of labour and exchange"

"If man ’s feelings passions etc are not merely anthropological phenomena in the narrower sense but truly ontological 41 affirmations of being of nature and if they are only really affirmed because their object exists for them as a sensual object then it is clear that"
"They have by no means merely one mode of affirmation but rather that the distinct character of their existence of their life is constituted by the distinct mode of their affirmation"
"Wherever the sensuous affirmation is the direct annulment of the object in its independent form as in eating drinking working up of the object etc this is the affirmation of the object"
"Insofar as man and hence also his feeling etc"
"is human the affirmation of the object by another is likewise his own gratification"
"Only through developed industry i.e. through the medium of private property does the ontological essence of human passion come into being in its totality as well as in its humanity the science of man is therefore itself a product of man ’s own practical activity"
"The meaning of private property apart from its estrangement is the existence of essential objects for man both as objects of enjoyment and as objects of activity"
"By possessing the property of buying everything by possessing the property of appropriating all objects money is thus the object of eminent possession"
"The universality of its property is the omnipotence of its being"
"It is therefore regarded as an omnipotent being"

"that am I myself the possessor of the money"
"The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power"
"Money ’s properties are my"

"It is the common whore the common procurer of people and nations"
"The distorting and confounding of all human and natural qualities the fraternisation of impossibilities the divine power of money lies in its character as men ’s estranged alienating and self disposing"
"Money is the alienated ability of mankind"
"That which I am unable to do as a man and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable I am able to do by means of money"

"In effecting this mediation money is the truly creative power"
"No doubt the demand also exists for him who has no money but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me for a third party for the others],||XLIII| and which therefore remains even for me unreal and objectless"
"The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need my passion my wish etc is the difference between being and thinking between that which exists within me merely as an idea and the idea which exists as a real object outside of me"
"If I have the vocation for study but no money for it I have no vocation for study that is no effective no true vocation"
"On the other hand if I have really no vocation for study but have the will and the money for it I have an effective vocation for it"
"Money as the external universal medium and faculty not springing from man as man or from human society as society for turning an image into reality and reality into a mere image transforms the real essential powers of man and nature into what are merely abstract notions and therefore imperfections and tormenting chimeras just as it transforms real imperfections and chimeras essential powers which are really impotent which exist only in the imagination of the individual into real powers and faculties"
"In the light of this characteristic alone money is thus the general distorting of individualities which turns them into their opposite and confers contradictory attributes upon their attributes"
"Money then appears as this distorting power both against the individual and against the bonds of society etc which claim to be entities in themselves"
"It transforms fidelity into infidelity love into hate hate into love virtue into vice vice into virtue servant into master master into servant idiocy into intelligence and intelligence into idiocy"
"Since money as the existing and active concept of value confounds and confuses all things it is the general confounding and confusing of all things the world upside down the confounding and confusing of all natural and human qualities"
"He who can buy bravery is brave though he be a coward"
"As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality for any one specific thing or for any particular human essential power but for the entire objective world of man and nature from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every quality for every other even contradictory quality and object it is the fraternisation of impossibilities"
"It makes contradictions embrace"
"Assume man to be man and his relationship to the world to be a human one then you can exchange love only for love trust for trust etc"
"If you want to enjoy art you must be an artistically cultivated person if you want to exercise influence over other people you must be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people"
"Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a specific expression corresponding to the object of your will of your real individual life"
"If you love without evoking love in return that is if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a beloved one then your love is impotent a misfortune.|XLIII||"
"Preface and Table of Contents | Critique of Hegel ’s Philosophy Marx Engels Internet Archive"
"This is perhaps the place at which by way of explanation and justification we might offer some considerations in regard to the Hegelian dialectic generally and especially its exposition in the Phänomenologie and Logik and also lastly the relation to it of the modern critical movement.[42"
"So powerful was modern German criticism ’s preoccupation with the past so completely was its development entangled with the subject matter that here prevailed a completely uncritical attitude to the method of criticising together with a complete lack of awareness about the apparently formal but really vital question"
"how do we now stand as regards the Hegelian dialectic"
"This lack of awareness about the relationship of modern criticism to the Hegelian philosophy as a whole and especially to the Hegelian dialectic has been so great that critics like Strauss and Bruno Bauer still remain within the confines of the Hegelian logic the former completely so and the latter at least implicitly so in his Synoptiker where in opposition to Strauss he replaces the substance of abstract nature by the self consciousness of abstract man and even in Das entdeckte Christenthum"
"Thus in Das entdeckte Christenthum for example you get"
"As though in positing the world self consciousness does not posit that which is different from itself and in what it is creating it does not create itself since it in turn annuls the difference between what it has created and itself since it itself has being only in creating and in the movement as though its purpose were not this movement"
"or again They the French materialists have not yet been able to see that it is only as the movement of self consciousness that the movement of the universe has actually come to be for itself and achieved unity with itself"
"Pp 113 114 15"
"Such expressions do not even show any verbal divergence from the Hegelian approach but on the contrary repeat it word for word"
"||XII| How little consciousness there was in relation to the Hegelian dialectic during the act of criticism Bauer the Synoptiker and how little this consciousness came into being even after the act of material criticism is proved by Bauer when in his Die gute Sache der Freiheit he dismisses the brash question put by Herr Gruppe What about logic now by referring him to future critics.[43"
"But even now now that Feuerbach both in his Thesen in the Anekdota and in detail in the Philosophie der Zukunft has in principle overthrown the old dialectic and philosophy now that that school of criticism on the other hand which was incapable of accomplishing this has all the same seen it accomplished and has proclaimed itself pure resolute absolute criticism that has come into the clear with itself now that this criticism in its spiritual pride has reduced the whole process of history to the relation between the rest of the world and itself the rest of the world in contrast to itself falling under the category of the masses and dissolved all dogmatic antitheses into the single dogmatic antithesis of its own cleverness and the stupidity of the world the antithesis of the critical Christ and Mankind the rabble now that daily and hourly it has demonstrated its own excellence against the dullness of the masses now finally that it has proclaimed the critical Last Judgment in the shape of an announcement that the day is approaching when the whole of decadent humanity will assemble before it and be sorted by it into groups each particular mob receiving its testimonium paupertatis now that it has made known in print its superiority to human feelings as well as its superiority to the world over which it sits enthroned in sublime solitude only letting fall from time to time from its sarcastic lips the ringing laughter of the Olympian Gods even now after all these delightful antics of idealism i.e. of Young Hegelianism expiring in the guise of criticism even now it has not expressed the suspicion that the time was ripe for a critical settling of accounts with the mother of Young Hegelianism the Hegelian dialectic and even had nothing to say about its critical attitude towards the Feuerbachian dialectic"
"This shows a completely uncritical attitude to itself"
"Feuerbach is the only one who has a serious critical attitude to the Hegelian dialectic and who has made genuine discoveries in this field"
"He is in fact the true conqueror of the old philosophy"
"The extent of his achievement and the unpretentious simplicity with which he Feuerbach gives it to the world stand in striking contrast to the opposite attitude of the others"
"The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thought and expounded by thought i.e. another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man hence equally to be condemned"
"The establishment of true materialism and of real science by making the social relationship of man to man"
"the basic principle of the theory 3"
"His opposing to the negation of the negation which claims to be the absolute positive the self supporting positive positively based on itself"
"Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic and thereby justifies starting out from the positive facts which we know by the senses as follows"
"Hegel sets out from the estrangement of substance in logic from the infinite abstractly universal from the absolute and fixed abstraction which means put popularly that he sets out from religion and theology"
"Secondly he annuls the infinite and posits the actual sensuous real finite particular philosophy annulment of religion and theology"
"Thirdly he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction the infinite restoration of religion and theology"
"Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation only as a contradiction of philosophy with itself as the philosophy which affirms theology the transcendent etc"
"after having denied it and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself"
"The positive position or self affirmation and self confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself which is therefore burdened with its opposite which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof and which therefore is not a position demonstrating itself by its existence not an acknowledged ||XIII| position hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the position of sense certainty based on itself"
"But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it as the true and only positive and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and spontaneous activity of all being he has only found the abstract logical speculative expression for the movement of history which is not yet the real history of man as a given subject but only the act of creation the history of the origin of man"
"We shall explain both the abstract form of this process and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach ’s Wesen des Christenthums or rather the critical form of this in Hegel still uncritical process"
"Let us take a look at the Hegelian system"
"One must begin with Hegel ’s Phänomenologie the true point of origin and the secret of the Hegelian philosophy"
"a Certainty at the level of sense experience or the this and meaning"
"b Perception or the thing with its properties and deception"
"g Force and understanding appearance and the supersensible world"
"The truth of certainty of self"
"a Independence and dependence of self consciousness mastery and servitude"

"b Realisation of rational self consciousness through its own activity"
"The law of the heart and the insanity of self conceit"
"Virtue and the course of the world"
"The individuality which is real in and for itself"
"The spiritual animal kingdom and the deception or the real fact"
"Reason which tests laws"
"I. True mind ethics"
"Mind in self estrangement culture"
"Mind certain of itself morality"
"Natural religion religion of art revealed religion"
"Hegel ’s Encyklopädie beginning as it does with logic with pure speculative thought and ending with absolute knowledge with the self conscious self comprehending philosophic or absolute i.e. superhuman abstract mind is in its entirety nothing but the display the self objectification of the essence of the philosophic mind and"
"the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self estrangement i.e. comprehending itself abstractly"
"Logic mind ’s coin of the realm the speculative or mental value of man and nature its essence which has grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness and hence unreal is alienated thinking and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man abstract thinking"
"Then The externality of this abstract thinking nature as it is for this abstract thinking"
"Nature is external to it its self loss and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion as abstract thought but as alienated abstract thinking"
"Finally mind this thinking returning home to its own point of origin the thinking which as the anthropological phenomenological psychological ethical artistic and religious mind is not valid for itself until ultimately it finds itself and affirms itself as absolute knowledge and hence absolute i.e. abstract mind thus receiving its conscious embodiment in the mode of existence corresponding to it"
"For its real mode of existence is abstraction"
"There is a double error in Hegel"
"The first emerges most clearly in the Phänomenologie the birth place of the Hegelian philosophy"
"When for instance wealth state power etc are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the human being this only happens in their form as thoughts"
"They are thought entities and therefore merely an estrangement of pure i.e. abstract philosophical thinking"
"The whole process therefore ends with absolute knowledge"
"It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their presumption of reality"
"The philosopher who is himself an abstract form of estranged man takes himself as the criterion of the estranged world"
"thought of logical speculative thought"
"The estrangement Entfremdung which therefore forms the real interest of the transcendence Aufhebung of this alienation"
"� erung is the opposition of in itself and for itself of consciousness and self consciousness of object and subject that is to say it is the opposition between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness within thought itself"
"All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the semblance the cloak the exoteric shape of these oppositions which alone matter and which constitute the meaning of these other profane oppositions"
"It is not the fact that the human being objectifies himself inhumanly in opposition to himself but the fact that he objectifies himself selbst sich vergegenst � ndlicht in distinction from and in opposition to abstract thinking that constitutes the posited essence of the estrangement Entfremdung and the thing to be superseded aufzuhebende"
"The appropriation of man ’s essential powers which have become objects indeed alien objects is thus in the first place only an appropriation occurring in consciousness in pure thought i.e. in abstraction it is the appropriation of these objects as thoughts and as movements of thought"
"Consequently despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the genuine criticism contained in it which often anticipates far later development there is already latent in the Phänomenologie as a germ a potentiality a secret the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel ’s later works that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world"
"In the second place the vindication of the objective world for man for example the realisation that sensuous consciousness is not an abstractly sensuous consciousness but a humanly sensuous consciousness that religion wealth etc are but the estranged world of human objectification of man ’s essential powers put to work and that they are therefore but the path to the true human world this appropriation or the insight into this process appears in Hegel therefore in this form"
"that sense religion state power etc are spiritual entities for only mind is the true essence of man and the true form of mind is thinking mind theological speculative mind"
"The Phänomenologie is therefore a hidden mystifying and still uncertain criticism but inasmuch as it depicts man ’s estrangement even though man appears only as mind there lie concealed in it all the elements of criticism already prepared and elaborated in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint"
"The unhappy consciousness the honest consciousness the struggle of the noble and base consciousness etc"
"these separate sections contain but still in an estranged form the critical elements of whole spheres such as religion the state civil life etc"
"Just as entities objects appear as thought entities so the subject is always consciousness or self consciousness or rather the object appears only as abstract consciousness man only as self consciousness the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are therefore only various forms of consciousness and self consciousness"
"Just as in itself abstract consciousness the form in which the object is conceived is merely a moment of distinction of self consciousness what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self consciousness with consciousness absolute knowledge the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but proceeding now only within its own self that is to say the dialectic of pure thought is the result"
"The outstanding achievement of Hegel ’s Phänomenologie and of its final outcome the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle is thus first that Hegel conceives the self creation of man as a process conceives objectification as loss of the object as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation that he thus grasps the essence of labour and comprehends objective man true because real man as the outcome of man ’s own labour"
"The real active orientation of man to himself as a species being or his manifestation as a real species being i.e. as a human being is only possible if he really brings out all his species powers something which in turn is only possible through the cooperative action of all of mankind only as the result of history and treats these powers as objects and this to begin with is again only possible in the form of estrangement"
"We shall now demonstrate in detail"
"Hegel ’s one sidedness and limitations as they are displayed in the final chapter of the Phänomenologie Absolute Knowledge a chapter which contains the condensed spirit of the Phänomenologie the relationship of the Phänomenologie to speculative dialectic and also Hegel ’s consciousness concerning both and their relationship to one another"
"He grasps labour as the essence of man as man ’s essence which stands the test he sees only the positive not the negative side of labour"
"Labour is man ’s coming to be for himself within alienation or as alienated man"
"The only labour which Hegel knows and recognises is abstractly mental labour"
"Therefore that which constitutes the essence of philosophy the alienation of man who knows himself or alienated science thinking itself Hegel grasps as its essence and in contradistinction to previous philosophy he is therefore able to combine its separate aspects and to present his philosophy as the philosophy"
"What the other philosophers did that they grasped separate phases of nature and of abstract self consciousness namely of human life as phases of self consciousness is known to Hegel as the doings of philosophy"
"Hence his science is absolute"
"Let us now turn to our subject"
"The last chapter of the Phänomenologie"
"The main point is that the object of consciousness is nothing else but self consciousness or that the object is only objectified self consciousness self consciousness as object"
"Positing of man = self consciousness"
"The issue therefore is to surmount the object of consciousness"
"Objectivity as such is regarded as an estranged human relationship which does not correspond to the essence of man to self consciousness"
"The reappropriation of the objective essence of man produced within the orbit of estrangement as something alien therefore denotes not only the annulment of estrangement but of objectivity as well"
"Man that is to say is regarded as a non objective spiritual being"
"The movement of surmounting the object of consciousness is now described by Hegel in the following way"
"Man is equated with self"
"The self however is only the abstractly conceived man man created by abstraction"
"His eye his ear etc are selfish"
"In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of selfhood"
"But it is quite false to say on that account self consciousness has eyes ears essential powers"
"Self consciousness is rather a quality of human nature of the human eye etc"
"it is not human nature that is a quality of ||XXIV| self consciousness"
"The self abstracted entity fixed for itself is man as abstract egoist egoism raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought"
"We shall return to this point later"
"For Hegel the human being man equals self consciousness"
"All estrangement of the human being is therefore nothing but estrangement of self consciousness"
"Instead the actual estrangement that which appears real is according to its innermost hidden nature which is only brought to light by philosophy nothing but the manifestation of the estrangement of the real human essence of self consciousness"
"The science which comprehends this is therefore called phenomenology"
"All reappropriation of the estranged objective essence appears therefore as incorporation into self consciousness The man who takes hold of his essential being is merely the self consciousness which takes hold of objective essences"
"Return of the object into the self is therefore the reappropriation of the object"
"Expressed in all its aspects the surmounting of the object of consciousness means 1 That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing"
"2 That it is the alienation of self consciousness which posits thinghood.[48 3 That this alienation has not merely a negative but a positive significance"
"For self consciousness the negative of the object or its annulling of itself has positive significance or it knows this futility of the object because of the fact that it alienates itself for in this alienation it posits itself as object or for the sake of the indivisible unity of being for self posits the object as itself"
"On the other hand this contains likewise the other moment that self consciousness has also just as much superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself being thus at home in its other being as such"
"8) Consciousness must similarly be related to the object in the totality of its determinations and have comprehended it in terms of each of them"
"This totality of its determinations makes the object intrinsically a spiritual being and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each one of the determinations as self or through what was called above the spiritual attitude to them"
"49 As to 1 That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing this is the above mentioned return of the object into the self"
"As to 2 The alienation of self consciousness posits thinghood"
"Because man equals self consciousness his alienated objective essence or thinghood equals alienated self consciousness and thinghood is thus posited through this alienation"
"thinghood being that which is an object for man and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object therefore his objective essence"
"And since it is not real man nor therefore nature man being human nature who as such is made the subject but only the abstraction of man self consciousness thinghood can not be anything but alienated self consciousness"
"It is only to be expected that a living natural being equipped and endowed with objective i.e. material essential powers should have real natural objects of his essence and that his self alienation should lead to the positing of a real objective world but within the framework of externality and therefore an overwhelming world not belonging to his own essential being"
"There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this"
"It would be mysterious rather if it were otherwise"
"But it is equally clear that a self consciousness by its alienation can posit only thinghood i.e. only an abstract thing a thing of abstraction and not a real thing"
"It is ||XXVI| 50 clear further that thinghood is therefore utterly without any independence any essentiality vis à vis self consciousness that on the contrary it is a mere creature something posited by self consciousness"
"And what is posited instead of confirming itself is but confirmation of the act of positing which for a moment fixes its energy as the product and gives it the semblance but only for a moment of an independent real substance"
"Whenever real corporeal man man with his feet firmly on the solid ground man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature posits his real objective essential powers as alien objects by his externalisation it is not the act of positing which is the subject in this process it is the subjectivity of objective essential powers whose action therefore must also be something objective"
"An objective being acts objectively and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being"
"He only creates or posits objects because he is posited by objects because at bottom he is nature"
"In the act of positing therefore this objective being does not fall from his state of pure activity into a creating of the object on the contrary his objective product only confirms his objective activity his activity as the activity of an objective natural being"
"We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the action of world history"
"< Man is directly a natural being"
"As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand endowed with natural powers vital powers he is an active natural being"
"These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities as instincts"
"On the other hand as a natural corporeal sensuous objective being he is a suffering conditioned and limited"
"creature like animals and plants"
"That is to say the objects of his instincts exist outside him as objects independent of him yet these objects are objects that he needs essential objects indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers"
"To say that man is a corporeal living real sensuous objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has real sensuous objects as the object of his being or of his life or that he can only express his life in real sensuous objects"
"To be objective natural and sensuous and at the same time to have object nature and sense outside oneself or oneself to be object nature and sense for a third party is one and the same thing"
"Hunger is a natural need it therefore needs a nature outside itself an object outside itself in order to satisfy itself to be stilled"
"Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an object existing outside it indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being"
"The sun is the object of the plant an indispensable object to it confirming its life just as the plant is an object of the sun being an expression of the life awakening power of the sun of the sun ’s objective essential power"
"A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a natural being and plays no part in the system of nature"
"A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being"
"A being which is not itself an object for some third being has no being for its object i.e. it is not objectively related"
"Its being is not objective"
"||XXVII| A non objective being is a non being"
"Suppose a being which is neither an object itself nor has an object"
"Such a being in the first place would be the unique being there would exist no being outside it it would exist solitary and alone"
"For as soon as there are objects outside me as soon as I am not alone I am another another reality than the object outside me"
"For this third object I am thus a different reality than itself that is I am its object"
"Thus to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that no objective being exists"
"As soon as I have an object this object has me for an object"
"To be sensuous that is to be really existing means to be an object of sense to be a sensuous object to have sensuous objects outside oneself objects of one ’s sensuousness"
"To be sensuous is to suffer"
"Man as an objective sensuous being is therefore a suffering being and because he feels that he suffers a passionate being"
"Passion is the essential power of man energetically bent on its object"
"But man is not merely a natural being he is a human natural being"
"That is to say he is a being for himself"
"Therefore he is a species being and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing"
"Therefore human objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves and neither is human sense as it immediately is as it is objectively human sensibility human objectivity"
"Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the human being"
"And as everything natural has to come into being man too has his act of origin history which however is for him a known history and hence as an act of origin it is a conscious self transcending act of origin"
"History is the true natural history of man on which more later"
"Thirdly because this positing of thinghood is itself only an illusion an act contradicting the nature of pure activity it has to be cancelled again and thinghood denied"
"Re 3 4 5 and 6"
"� erung of consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance and 4"
"it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically but for consciousness itself"
"On the other hand there is also this other moment in the process that consciousness has also just as much superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself being thus at home in its other being as such"
"As we have already seen the appropriation of what is estranged and objective or the annulling of objectivity in the form of estrangement which has to advance from indifferent strangeness to real antagonistic estrangement means likewise or even primarily for Hegel that it is objectivity which is to be annulled because it is not the determinate character of the object but rather its objective character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self consciousness"
"This nullity of the object has not only a negative but a positive meaning for consciousness since this nullity of the object is precisely the self confirmation of the non objectivity of the ||XXVIII| abstraction of itself"
"For consciousness itself the nullity of the object has a positive meaning because it knows this nullity the objective being as its self alienation because it knows that it exists only as a result of its own self alienation"
"The way in which consciousness is and in which something is for it is knowing"
"Knowing is its sole act"
"Something therefore comes to be for consciousness insofar as the latter knows this something"
"Knowing is its sole objective relation"
"It consciousness then knows the nullity of the object i.e. knows the non existence of the distinction between the object and itself the non existence of the object for it because it knows the object as its self alienation that is it knows itself knows knowing as object because the object is only the semblance of an object a piece of mystification which in its essence however is nothing else but knowing itself which has confronted itself with itself and hence has confronted itself with a nullity a something which has no objectivity outside the knowing"
"Or knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only outside itself that it only externalises itself that it itself only appears to itself as an object or that that which appears to it as an object is only itself"
"On the other hand says Hegel there is here at the same time this other moment that consciousness has just as much annulled and reabsorbed this externalisation and objectivity being thus at home in its other being as such"
"In this discussion all the illusions of speculation are brought together"
"First of all consciousness self consciousness is at home in its other being as such"
"It is therefore or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self consciousness of man instead of self consciousness it is at home in its other being as such"
"This implies for one thing that consciousness knowing as knowing thinking as thinking pretends to be directly the other of itself to be the world of sense the real world life thought surpassing itself in thought"
"This aspect is contained herein inasmuch as consciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity but at objectivity as such"
"Secondly this implies that self conscious man insofar as he has recognised and superseded the spiritual world or his world ’s spiritual general mode of being as self alienation nevertheless again confirms it in this alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being re establishes it and pretends to be at home in his other being as such"
"Thus for instance after superseding religion after recognising religion to be a product of self alienation he yet finds confirmation of himself in religion as religion"
"Here is the root of Hegel ’s false positivism or of his merely apparent criticism this is what Feuerbach designated as the positing negating and re establishing of religion or theology but it has to be expressed in more general terms"
"Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason"
"The man who has recognised that he is leading an alienated life in law politics etc is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such"
"Self affirmation self confirmation in contradiction with itself in contradiction both with the knowledge of and with the essential being of the object is thus true knowledge and life"
"part vis à vis religion the state etc since this lie is the lie of his principle"
"If I know religion as alienated human self consciousness then what I know in it as religion is not my self consciousness but my alienated self consciousness confirmed in it"
"I therefore know my self consciousness that belongs to itself to its very nature confirmed not in religion but rather in annihilated and superseded religion"
"In Hegel therefore the negation of the negation is not the confirmation of the true essence effected precisely through negation of the pseudo essence"
"A peculiar role therefore is played by the act of superseding in which denial and preservation i.e. affirmation are bound together"
"Thus for example in Hegel ’s philosophy of law civil law superseded equals morality morality superseded equals the family the family superseded equals civil society civil society superseded equals the state the state superseded equals world history"
"In the actual world civil law morality the family civil society the state etc remain in existence only they have become moments states of the existence and being of man which have no validity in isolation but dissolve and engender one another etc"
"In their actual existence this mobile nature of theirs is hidden"
"It appears and is made manifest only in thought in philosophy"
"Hence my true religious existence is my existence in the philosophy of religion my true political existence is my existence in the philosophy of law my true natural existence existence in the philosophy of nature my true artistic existence existence in the philosophy of art my true human existence my existence in philosophy"
"Likewise the true existence of religion the state nature art is the philosophy of religion of nature of the state and of art"
"If however the philosophy of religion etc is for me the sole true existence of religion then too it is only as a philosopher of religion that I am truly religious and so I deny real religious sentiment and the really religious man"
"But at the same time I assert them in part within my own existence or within the alien existence which I oppose to them for"
"this is only their philosophic expression and in part I assert them in their distinct original shape since for me they represent merely the apparent other being allegories forms of their own true existence i.e. of my philosophical existence hidden under sensuous disguises"
"In just the same way quality superseded equals quantity quantity superseded equals measure measure superseded equals essence essence superseded equals appearance appearance superseded equals actuality actuality superseded equals the concept the concept superseded equals objectivity objectivity superseded equals the absolute idea"
"the absolute idea superseded equals nature nature superseded equals subjective mind subjective mind superseded equals ethical objective mind"
"ethical mind superseded equals art art superseded equals religion religion superseded equals absolute knowledge.[52"
"On the one hand this act of superseding is a transcending of a conceptual entity thus private property as a concept is transcended in the concept of morality"
"And because thought imagines itself to be directly the other of itself to be sensuous reality and therefore takes its own action for sensuous real action this superseding in thought which leaves its object in existence in the real world believes that it has really overcome it"
"On the other hand because the object has now become for it a moment of thought thought takes it in its reality too to be self confirmation of itself of self consciousness of abstraction"
"||XXX| From the one point of view the entity which Hegel supersedes in philosophy is therefore not real religion the real state or real nature but religion itself already as an object of knowledge i.e. dogmatics the same with jurisprudence political science and natural science"
"From the one point of view therefore he stands in opposition both to the real thing and to immediate unphilosophic science or the unphilosophic conceptions of this thing"
"He therefore contradicts their conventional conceptions"
"The conventional conception of theology jurisprudence political science natural science etc"
"On the other hand the religious etc man can find in Hegel his final confirmation"
"It is now time to formulate the positive aspects of the Hegelian dialectic within the realm of estrangement"
"a Supersession as an objective movement of retracting the alienation into self"
"This is the insight expressed within the estrangement concerning the appropriation of the objective essence through the supersession of its estrangement it is the estranged insight into the real objectification of man into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the estranged character of the objective world through the supersession of the objective world in its estranged mode of being"
"In the same way atheism being the supersession of God is the advent of theoretic humanism and communism as the supersession of private property is the vindication of real human life as man ’s possession and thus the advent of practical humanism or atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of religion whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of private property"
"Only through the supersession of this mediation which is itself however a necessary premise does positively self deriving humanism positive humanism come into being"
"Thus by grasping the positive meaning of self referred negation although again in estranged fashion"
"Hegel grasps man ’s self estrangement the alienation of man ’s"
"essence man ’s loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as self discovery manifestation of his nature objectification and realisation"
"In short within the sphere of abstraction Hegel conceives labour as man ’s act of self genesis conceives man"
"’s relation to himself as an alien being and the manifestation of himself as an alien being to be the emergence of species consciousness and species life"
"However apart from or rather in consequence of the referral already described this act appears in Hegel First as a merely formal because abstract act because the human being itself is taken to be only an abstract thinking being conceived merely as self consciousness"
"And Secondly because the exposition is formal and abstract the supersession of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation or for Hegel this movement of self genesis and self objectification in the form of self alienation and self estrangement is the absolute and hence final expression of human life of life with itself as its aim of life at peace with itself and in unity with its essence"
"This movement in its abstract ||XXXI| form as dialectic is therefore regarded as truly human life and because it is nevertheless an abstraction an estrangement of human life it is regarded as a divine process but as the divine process of man a process traversed by man ’s"
"abstract pure absolute essence that is distinct from himself"
"Thirdly this process must have a bearer a subject"
"But the subject only comes into being as a result"
"the subject knowing itself as absolute self consciousness is therefore God absolute Spirit the self knowing and self manifesting idea"
"Subject and predicate are therefore related to each other in absolute reversal a mystical subject object or a subjectivity reaching beyond the object the absolute subject as a process as subject alienating itself and returning from alienation into itself but at the same time retracting this alienation into itself and the subject as this process a pure incessant revolving within itself"
"Formal and abstract conception of man ’s act of self creation or self objectification"
"Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self consciousness the estranged object the estranged essential reality of man is nothing but consciousness the thought of estrangement merely estrangement ’s abstract and therefore empty and unreal expression negation"
"The supersession of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract empty supersession of that empty abstraction the negation of the negation"
"The rich living sensuous concrete activity of self objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction absolute negativity an abstraction which is again fixed as such and considered as an independent activity as sheer activity"
"Because this so called negativity is nothing but the abstract empty form of that real living act its content can in consequence be merely a formal content produced by abstraction from all content"
"We shall unfold the logical content of absolute negativity further on"
"| Hegel ’s positive achievement here in his speculative logic is that the definite concepts the universal fixed thought forms in their independence vis à vis nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human being and therefore also of a human thought and that Hegel has therefore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction process"
"For example superseded being is essence superseded essence is concept the concept superseded is absolute idea"
"But what then is the absolute idea"
"It supersedes its own self again if it does not want to traverse once more from the beginning the whole act of abstraction and to satisfy itself with being a totality of abstractions or the self comprehending abstraction"
"Thus the entire logic is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself that the absolute idea is nothing for itself that only nature is something"
"The absolute idea the abstract idea which considered with regard to its unity with itself is intuiting Logic 244 and which loc cit"
"in its own absolute truth resolves to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterisation and other being the immediate idea as its reflection go forth freely from itself as nature loc"
"this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and bizarre way and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches is from beginning to end nothing else but abstraction i.e. the abstract thinker which made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth resolves under various false and themselves still abstract conditions to abandon itself and to replace its self absorption nothingness generality and indeterminateness by its other being the particular and the determinate resolves to let nature which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction as a thought entity go forth freely from itself that is to say this idea resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature free of abstraction"
"This entire transition from logic to natural philosophy is nothing else but the transition so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker who therefore describes it in such an adventurous way from abstracting to intuiting"
"The mystical feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is boredom the longing for content"
"The man estranged from himself"
"is also the thinker estranged from his essence that is from the natural and human essence"
"His thoughts are therefore fixed mental forms dwelling outside nature and man"
"that is as a superseding of this alienation as a real expression of human thought"
"This means that what Hegel does is to put in place of these fixed abstractions the act of abstraction which revolves in its own circle"
"We must therefore give him the credit for having indicated the source of all these inappropriate concepts which originally appertained to particular philosophers for having brought them together and for having created the entire compass of abstraction as the object of criticism instead of some specific abstraction"
"Note by Marx and in part to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself there makes its appearance in Hegel in the form of the resolution to recognise nature as the essential being and to go over to intuition the abandonment of abstract thought the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought of thought sans eyes sans teeth sans ears sans everything"
"But nature too taken abstractly for itself nature fixed in isolation from man is nothing for man"
"It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting intuits nature abstractly"
"Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea in the form of a thought entity in a shape which was obscure and enigmatic even to him so by letting it emerge from himself he has really let emerge only this abstract nature only nature as a thought entity but now with the significance that it is the other being of thought that it is real intuited nature nature distinguished from abstract thought"
"Or to talk in human language the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing from pure abstraction the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought for ever shuttling back and forth in itself and never looking outward into reality are nothing else but abstractions from characteristics of nature"
"To him therefore the whole of nature merely repeats the logical abstractions in a sensuous external form"
"He once more resolves nature into these abstractions"
"Thus his intuition of nature is only the act of confirming his abstraction from the intuition of nature"
"Hegel ’s characteristics of nature and the transition from nature to the mind"
"Nature has resulted as the idea in the form of the other being"
"Since the i d is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of creating his abstraction"
"Thus for example time equals negativity referred to itself Hegel Encyclopädie"
"To the superseded becoming as being there corresponds in natural form superseded movement as matter"
"Light is reflection in itself the natural form"
"Body as moon and comet is the natural form of the antithesis which according to logic is on the one side the positive resting on itself and on the other side the negative resting on itself"
"The earth is the natural form of the logical ground as the negative unity of the antithesis etc"
"Nature as nature that is to say insofar as it is still sensuously distinguished from that secret sense hidden within it nature isolated distinguished from these abstractions is nothing a nothing proving itself to be nothing is devoid of sense or has only the sense of being an externality which has to be annulled"
"In the finite teleological position is to be found the correct premise that nature does not contain within itself the absolute purpose"
"Nature has shown itself to be the idea in the form of other being"
"Since the idea is in this form the negative of itself or external to itself nature is not just relatively external vis à vis this idea but externality constitutes the form in which it exists as nature"
"Externality here is not to be understood as the world of sense which manifests itself and is accessible to the light to the man endowed with senses"
"It is to be taken here in the sense of alienation of a mistake a defect which ought not to be"
"For what is true is still the idea"
"Nature is only the form of the idea ’s other being"
"And since abstract thought is the essence that which is external to it is by its essence something merely external"
"The abstract thinker recognises at the same time that sensuousness externality in contrast to thought shuttling back and forth within itself is the essence of nature"
"||XXXIV| An entity which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself intrinsically has something outside itself which it lacks"
"That is its essence is different from it itself"
"Nature has therefore to supersede itself for the abstract thinker for it is already posited by him as a potentially superseded being"
"For us mind has nature for its premise being nature ’s truth and for that reason its absolute prius"
"In this truth nature has vanished and mind has resulted as the idea arrived at being for itself the object of which as well as the subject is the concept"
"This identity is absolute negativity for whereas in nature the concept has its perfect external objectivity this its alienation has been superseded and in this alienation the concept has become identical with itself"
"But it is this identity therefore only in being a return out of nature"
"As the abstract idea revelation is unmediated transition to the coming to be of nature as the revelation of the mind which is free it is the positing of nature as the mind ’s world a positing which being reflection is at the same time a presupposing of the world as independently existing nature"
"Revelation in conception is the creation of nature as the mind ’s being in which the mind procures the affirmation and the truth of its freedom"
"The absolute is mind"
"This is the highest definition of the absolute"

"His opposing to the negation of the negation which claims to be the absolute positive the self supporting positive positively based on itself"
"Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic and thereby justifies starting out from the positive facts which we know by the senses as follows"
"Hegel sets out from the estrangement of substance in logic from the infinite abstractly universal from the absolute and fixed abstraction which means put popularly that he sets out from religion and theology"
"Secondly he annuls the infinite and posits the actual sensuous real finite particular philosophy annulment of religion and theology"
"Thirdly he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction the infinite restoration of religion and theology"
"Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation only as a contradiction of philosophy with itself as the philosophy which affirms theology the transcendent etc"
"after having denied it and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself"
"The positive position or self affirmation and self confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself which is therefore burdened with its opposite which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof and which therefore is not a position demonstrating itself by its existence not an acknowledged ||XIII| position hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the position of sense certainty based on itself"
"Feuerbach also defines the negation of the negation the definite concept as thinking surpassing itself in thinking and as thinking wanting to be directly awareness nature reality"
"Note by Marx 44"
"But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it as the true and only positive and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and spontaneous activity of all being he has only found the abstract logical speculative expression for the movement of history which is not yet the real history of man as a given subject but only the act of creation the history of the origin of man"
"We shall explain both the abstract form of this process and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach ’s Wesen des Christenthums or rather the critical form of this in Hegel still uncritical process"

"Hegel ’s Encyklopädie beginning as it does with logic with pure speculative thought and ending with absolute knowledge with the self conscious self comprehending philosophic or absolute i.e. superhuman abstract mind is in its entirety nothing but the display the self objectification of the essence of the philosophic mind and"
"the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self estrangement i.e. comprehending itself abstractly"
"Logic mind ’s coin of the realm the speculative or mental value of man and nature its essence which has grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness and hence unreal is alienated thinking and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man abstract thinking"
"Then The externality of this abstract thinking nature as it is for this abstract thinking"
"Nature is external to it its self loss and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion as abstract thought but as alienated abstract thinking"
"Finally mind this thinking returning home to its own point of origin the thinking which as the anthropological phenomenological psychological ethical artistic and religious mind is not valid for itself until ultimately it finds itself and affirms itself as absolute knowledge and hence absolute i.e. abstract mind thus receiving its conscious embodiment in the mode of existence corresponding to it"
"For its real mode of existence is abstraction"
"The first emerges most clearly in the Phänomenologie the birth place of the Hegelian philosophy"
"When for instance wealth state power etc are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the human being this only happens in their form as thoughts"
"They are thought entities and therefore merely an estrangement of pure i.e. abstract philosophical thinking"
"The whole process therefore ends with absolute knowledge"
"It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their presumption of reality"
"The philosopher who is himself an abstract form of estranged man takes himself as the criterion of the estranged world"
"The whole history of the alienation process Ent � u � erungsgeschichte and the whole process of the retraction of the alienation is therefore nothing but the history of the production of abstract i.e. absolute"
"thought of logical speculative thought"
"The estrangement Entfremdung which therefore forms the real interest of the transcendence Aufhebung of this alienation"
"� erung is the opposition of in itself and for itself of consciousness and self consciousness of object and subject that is to say it is the opposition between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness within thought itself"
"All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the semblance the cloak the exoteric shape of these oppositions which alone matter and which constitute the meaning of these other profane oppositions"
"It is not the fact that the human being objectifies himself inhumanly in opposition to himself but the fact that he objectifies himself selbst sich vergegenst � ndlicht in distinction from and in opposition to abstract thinking that constitutes the posited essence of the estrangement Entfremdung and the thing to be superseded aufzuhebende"
"Consequently despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the genuine criticism contained in it which often anticipates far later development there is already latent in the Phänomenologie as a germ a potentiality a secret the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel ’s later works that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world"
"In the second place the vindication of the objective world for man for example the realisation that sensuous consciousness is not an abstractly sensuous consciousness but a humanly sensuous consciousness that religion wealth etc are but the estranged world of human objectification of man ’s essential powers put to work and that they are therefore but the path to the true human world this appropriation or the insight into this process appears in Hegel therefore in this form"
"that sense religion state power etc are spiritual entities for only mind is the true essence of man and the true form of mind is thinking mind theological speculative mind"
"The human character of nature and of the nature created by history man ’s products appears in the form that they are products of abstract mind and as such therefore phases of mind thought entities"
"The Phänomenologie is therefore a hidden mystifying and still uncertain criticism but inasmuch as it depicts man ’s estrangement even though man appears only as mind there lie concealed in it all the elements of criticism already prepared and elaborated in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint"
"The unhappy consciousness the honest consciousness the struggle of the noble and base consciousness etc"
"these separate sections contain but still in an estranged form the critical elements of whole spheres such as religion the state civil life etc"
"Just as entities objects appear as thought entities so the subject is always consciousness or self consciousness or rather the object appears only as abstract consciousness man only as self consciousness the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are therefore only various forms of consciousness and self consciousness"
"Just as in itself abstract consciousness the form in which the object is conceived is merely a moment of distinction of self consciousness what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self consciousness with consciousness absolute knowledge the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but proceeding now only within its own self that is to say the dialectic of pure thought is the result"
"The outstanding achievement of Hegel ’s Phänomenologie and of its final outcome the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle is thus first that Hegel conceives the self creation of man as a process conceives objectification as loss of the object as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation that he thus grasps the essence of labour and comprehends objective man true because real man as the outcome of man ’s own labour"
"The real active orientation of man to himself as a species being or his manifestation as a real species being i.e. as a human being is only possible if he really brings out all his species powers something which in turn is only possible through the cooperative action of all of mankind only as the result of history and treats these powers as objects and this to begin with is again only possible in the form of estrangement"
"We shall now demonstrate in detail"
"Let us provisionally say just this much in advance Hegel ’s standpoint is that of modern political economy"
"He grasps labour as the essence of man as man ’s essence which stands the test he sees only the positive not the negative side of labour"
"The only labour which Hegel knows and recognises is abstractly mental labour"
"Therefore that which constitutes the essence of philosophy the alienation of man who knows himself or alienated science thinking itself Hegel grasps as its essence and in contradistinction to previous philosophy he is therefore able to combine its separate aspects and to present his philosophy as the philosophy"
"What the other philosophers did that they grasped separate phases of nature and of abstract self consciousness namely of human life as phases of self consciousness is known to Hegel as the doings of philosophy"
"Hence his science is absolute"
"The main point is that the object of consciousness is nothing else but self consciousness or that the object is only objectified self consciousness self consciousness as object"
"Objectivity as such is regarded as an estranged human relationship which does not correspond to the essence of man to self consciousness"
"The reappropriation of the objective essence of man produced within the orbit of estrangement as something alien therefore denotes not only the annulment of estrangement but of objectivity as well"
"Man that is to say is regarded as a non objective spiritual being"
"The movement of surmounting the object of consciousness is now described by Hegel in the following way"
"The object reveals itself not merely as returning into the self this is according to Hegel the one sided way of apprehending this movement the grasping of only one side"
"Man is equated with self"
"In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of selfhood"
"But it is quite false to say on that account self consciousness has eyes ears essential powers"
"Self consciousness is rather a quality of human nature of the human eye etc"
"it is not human nature that is a quality of ||XXIV| self consciousness"
"The self abstracted entity fixed for itself is man as abstract egoist egoism raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought"
"We shall return to this point later"
"For Hegel the human being man equals self consciousness"
"All estrangement of the human being is therefore nothing but estrangement of self consciousness"
"The estrangement of self consciousness is not regarded as an expression reflected in the realm of knowledge and thought of the real estrangement of the human being"
"Instead the actual estrangement that which appears real is according to its innermost hidden nature which is only brought to light by philosophy nothing but the manifestation of the estrangement of the real human essence of self consciousness"
"The science which comprehends this is therefore called phenomenology"
"All reappropriation of the estranged objective essence appears therefore as incorporation into self consciousness The man who takes hold of his essential being is merely the self consciousness which takes hold of objective essences"
"Expressed in all its aspects the surmounting of the object of consciousness means"
"1 That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing"
"2 That it is the alienation of self consciousness which posits thinghood.[48"
"4 That it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically but for self consciousness itself"
"For self consciousness the negative of the object or its annulling of itself has positive significance or it knows this futility of the object because of the fact that it alienates itself for in this alienation it posits itself as object or for the sake of the indivisible unity of being for self posits the object as itself"
"On the other hand this contains likewise the other moment that self consciousness has also just as much superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself being thus at home in its other being as such"
"This is the movement of consciousness and this is therefore the totality of its moments"
"8) Consciousness must similarly be related to the object in the totality of its determinations and have comprehended it in terms of each of them"
"This totality of its determinations makes the object intrinsically a spiritual being and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each one of the determinations as self or through what was called above the spiritual attitude to them"
"As to 2 The alienation of self consciousness posits thinghood"
"Because man equals self consciousness his alienated objective essence or thinghood equals alienated self consciousness and thinghood is thus posited through this alienation"
"thinghood being that which is an object for man and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object therefore his objective essence"
"And since it is not real man nor therefore nature man being human nature who as such is made the subject but only the abstraction of man self consciousness thinghood can not be anything but alienated self consciousness"
"It is only to be expected that a living natural being equipped and endowed with objective i.e. material essential powers should have real natural objects of his essence and that his self alienation should lead to the positing of a real objective world but within the framework of externality and therefore an overwhelming world not belonging to his own essential being"
"There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this"
"But it is equally clear that a self consciousness by its alienation can posit only thinghood i.e. only an abstract thing a thing of abstraction and not a real thing"
"It is ||XXVI| 50 clear further that thinghood is therefore utterly without any independence any essentiality vis à vis self consciousness that on the contrary it is a mere creature something posited by self consciousness"
"And what is posited instead of confirming itself is but confirmation of the act of positing which for a moment fixes its energy as the product and gives it the semblance but only for a moment of an independent real substance"
"Whenever real corporeal man man with his feet firmly on the solid ground man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature posits his real objective essential powers as alien objects by his externalisation it is not the act of positing which is the subject in this process it is the subjectivity of objective essential powers whose action therefore must also be something objective"
"An objective being acts objectively and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being"
"He only creates or posits objects because he is posited by objects because at bottom he is nature"
"Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism is distinct from both idealism and materialism and constitutes at the same time the unifying truth of both"
"We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the action of world history"
"As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand endowed with natural powers vital powers he is an active natural being"
"These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities as instincts"
"On the other hand as a natural corporeal sensuous objective being he is a suffering conditioned and limited"
"creature like animals and plants"
"That is to say the objects of his instincts exist outside him as objects independent of him yet these objects are objects that he needs essential objects indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers"
"To say that man is a corporeal living real sensuous objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has real sensuous objects as the object of his being or of his life or that he can only express his life in real sensuous objects"
"To be objective natural and sensuous and at the same time to have object nature and sense outside oneself or oneself to be object nature and sense for a third party is one and the same thing"
"Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an object existing outside it indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being"
"The sun is the object of the plant an indispensable object to it confirming its life just as the plant is an object of the sun being an expression of the life awakening power of the sun of the sun ’s objective essential power"
"A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a natural being and plays no part in the system of nature"
"A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being"
"Its being is not objective"
"||XXVII| A non objective being is a non being"
"Suppose a being which is neither an object itself nor has an object"
"Such a being in the first place would be the unique being there would exist no being outside it it would exist solitary and alone"
"For as soon as there are objects outside me as soon as I am not alone I am another another reality than the object outside me"
"For this third object I am thus a different reality than itself that is I am its object"
"Thus to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that no objective being exists"
"As soon as I have an object this object has me for an object"
"But a non objective being is an unreal non sensuous thing a product of mere thought i.e. of mere imagination an abstraction"
"To be sensuous that is to be really existing means to be an object of sense to be a sensuous object to have sensuous objects outside oneself objects of one ’s sensuousness"
"To be sensuous is to suffer"
"Man as an objective sensuous being is therefore a suffering being and because he feels that he suffers a passionate being"
"Passion is the essential power of man energetically bent on its object"
"< But man is not merely a natural being he is a human natural being"
"That is to say he is a being for himself"
"Therefore he is a species being and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing"
"Therefore human objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves and neither is human sense as it immediately is as it is objectively human sensibility human objectivity"
"Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the human being"
"And as everything natural has to come into being man too has his act of origin history which however is for him a known history and hence as an act of origin it is a conscious self transcending act of origin"
"History is the true natural history of man on which more later"
"Thirdly because this positing of thinghood is itself only an illusion an act contradicting the nature of pure activity it has to be cancelled again and thinghood denied"
"Re 3 4 5 and 6"
"� erung of consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance and 4"
"it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically but for consciousness itself"
"For consciousness the negative of the object its annulling of itself has positive significance i.e. consciousness knows this nullity of the object because it alienates itself for in this alienation it knows itself as object or for the sake of the indivisible unity of being for itself the object as itself"
"On the other hand there is also this other moment in the process that consciousness has also just as much superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself being thus at home in its other being as such"
"As we have already seen the appropriation of what is estranged and objective or the annulling of objectivity in the form of estrangement which has to advance from indifferent strangeness to real antagonistic estrangement means likewise or even primarily for Hegel that it is objectivity which is to be annulled because it is not the determinate character of the object but rather its objective character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self consciousness"
"The object is therefore something negative self annulling a nullity"
"For consciousness itself the nullity of the object has a positive meaning because it knows this nullity the objective being as its self alienation because it knows that it exists only as a result of its own self alienation"
"The way in which consciousness is and in which something is for it is knowing"
"Knowing is its sole act"
"Something therefore comes to be for consciousness insofar as the latter knows this something"
"Knowing is its sole objective relation"
"It consciousness then knows the nullity of the object i.e. knows the non existence of the distinction between the object and itself the non existence of the object for it because it knows the object as its self alienation that is it knows itself knows knowing as object because the object is only the semblance of an object a piece of mystification which in its essence however is nothing else but knowing itself which has confronted itself with itself and hence has confronted itself with a nullity a something which has no objectivity outside the knowing"
"Or knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only outside itself that it only externalises itself that it itself only appears to itself as an object or that that which appears to it as an object is only itself"
"On the other hand says Hegel there is here at the same time this other moment that consciousness has just as much annulled and reabsorbed this externalisation and objectivity being thus at home in its other being as such"
"In this discussion all the illusions of speculation are brought together"
"First of all consciousness self consciousness is at home in its other being as such"
"It is therefore or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self consciousness of man instead of self consciousness it is at home in its other being as such"
"This implies for one thing that consciousness knowing as knowing thinking as thinking pretends to be directly the other of itself to be the world of sense the real world life thought surpassing itself in thought"
"This aspect is contained herein inasmuch as consciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity but at objectivity as such"
"Secondly this implies that self conscious man insofar as he has recognised and superseded the spiritual world or his world ’s spiritual general mode of being as self alienation nevertheless again confirms it in this alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being re establishes it and pretends to be at home in his other being as such"
"Thus for instance after superseding religion after recognising religion to be a product of self alienation he yet finds confirmation of himself in religion as religion"
"Here is the root of Hegel ’s false positivism or of his merely apparent criticism this is what Feuerbach designated as the positing negating and re establishing of religion or theology but it has to be expressed in more general terms"
"Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason"
"The man who has recognised that he is leading an alienated life in law politics etc is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such"
"Self affirmation self confirmation in contradiction with itself in contradiction both with the knowledge of and with the essential being of the object is thus true knowledge and life"
"There can therefore no longer be any question about an act of accommodation on Hegel ’s"
"part vis à vis religion the state etc since this lie is the lie of his principle"
"If I know religion as alienated human self consciousness then what I know in it as religion is not my self consciousness but my alienated self consciousness confirmed in it"
"In Hegel therefore the negation of the negation is not the confirmation of the true essence effected precisely through negation of the pseudo essence"
"With him the negation of the negation is the confirmation of the pseudo essence or of the self estranged essence in its denial or it is the denial of this pseudo essence as an objective being dwelling outside man and independent of him and its transformation into the subject"
"A peculiar role therefore is played by the act of superseding in which denial and preservation i.e. affirmation are bound together"
"Thus for example in Hegel ’s philosophy of law civil law superseded equals morality morality superseded equals the family the family superseded equals civil society civil society superseded equals the state the state superseded equals world history"
"In the actual world civil law morality the family civil society the state etc remain in existence only they have become moments states of the existence and being of man which have no validity in isolation but dissolve and engender one another etc"
"They have become moments of motion"
"In their actual existence this mobile nature of theirs is hidden"
"It appears and is made manifest only in thought in philosophy"
"Hence my true religious existence is my existence in the philosophy of religion my true political existence is my existence in the philosophy of law my true natural existence existence in the philosophy of nature my true artistic existence existence in the philosophy of art my true human existence my existence in philosophy"
"Likewise the true existence of religion the state nature art is the philosophy of religion of nature of the state and of art"
"If however the philosophy of religion etc is for me the sole true existence of religion then too it is only as a philosopher of religion that I am truly religious and so I deny real religious sentiment and the really religious man"
"But at the same time I assert them in part within my own existence or within the alien existence which I oppose to them for"
"this is only their philosophic expression and in part I assert them in their distinct original shape since for me they represent merely the apparent other being allegories forms of their own true existence i.e. of my philosophical existence hidden under sensuous disguises"
"In just the same way quality superseded equals quantity quantity superseded equals measure measure superseded equals essence essence superseded equals appearance appearance superseded equals actuality actuality superseded equals the concept the concept superseded equals objectivity objectivity superseded equals the absolute idea"
"the absolute idea superseded equals nature nature superseded equals subjective mind subjective mind superseded equals ethical objective mind"
"ethical mind superseded equals art art superseded equals religion religion superseded equals absolute knowledge.[52"
"On the one hand this act of superseding is a transcending of a conceptual entity thus private property as a concept is transcended in the concept of morality"
"And because thought imagines itself to be directly the other of itself to be sensuous reality and therefore takes its own action for sensuous real action this superseding in thought which leaves its object in existence in the real world believes that it has really overcome it"
"On the other hand because the object has now become for it a moment of thought thought takes it in its reality too to be self confirmation of itself of self consciousness of abstraction"
"||XXX| From the one point of view the entity which Hegel supersedes in philosophy is therefore not real religion the real state or real nature but religion itself already as an object of knowledge i.e. dogmatics the same with jurisprudence political science and natural science"
"He therefore contradicts their conventional conceptions"
"The conventional conception of theology jurisprudence political science natural science etc"
"On the other hand the religious etc man can find in Hegel his final confirmation"
"It is now time to formulate the positive aspects of the Hegelian dialectic within the realm of estrangement"
"a Supersession as an objective movement of retracting the alienation into self"
"This is the insight expressed within the estrangement concerning the appropriation of the objective essence through the supersession of its estrangement it is the estranged insight into the real objectification of man into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the estranged character of the objective world through the supersession of the objective world in its estranged mode of being"
"In the same way atheism being the supersession of God is the advent of theoretic humanism and communism as the supersession of private property is the vindication of real human life as man ’s possession and thus the advent of practical humanism or atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of religion whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of private property"
"Only through the supersession of this mediation which is itself however a necessary premise does positively self deriving humanism positive humanism come into being"
"But atheism and communism are no flight no abstraction no loss of the objective world created by man of man ’s essential powers born to the realm of objectivity they are not a returning in poverty to unnatural primitive simplicity"
"On the contrary they are but the first real emergence the actual realisation for man of man ’s essence and of his essence as something real"
"Thus by grasping the positive meaning of self referred negation although again in estranged fashion"
"Hegel grasps man ’s self estrangement the alienation of man ’s"
"essence man ’s loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as self discovery manifestation of his nature objectification and realisation"
"In short within the sphere of abstraction Hegel conceives labour as man ’s act of self genesis conceives man"
"’s relation to himself as an alien being and the manifestation of himself as an alien being to be the emergence of species consciousness and species life >"
"However apart from or rather in consequence of the referral already described this act appears in Hegel"
"First as a merely formal because abstract act because the human being itself is taken to be only an abstract thinking being conceived merely as self consciousness"
"Secondly because the exposition is formal and abstract the supersession of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation or for Hegel this movement of self genesis and self objectification in the form of self alienation and self estrangement is the absolute and hence final expression of human life of life with itself as its aim of life at peace with itself and in unity with its essence"
"This movement in its abstract ||XXXI| form as dialectic is therefore regarded as truly human life and because it is nevertheless an abstraction an estrangement of human life it is regarded as a divine process but as the divine process of man a process traversed by man ’s"
"abstract pure absolute essence that is distinct from himself"
"Thirdly this process must have a bearer a subject"
"But the subject only comes into being as a result"
"the subject knowing itself as absolute self consciousness is therefore God absolute Spirit the self knowing and self manifesting idea"
"Real man and real nature become mere predicates symbols of this hidden unreal man and of this unreal nature"
"Formal and abstract conception of man ’s act of self creation or self objectification"
"Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self consciousness the estranged object the estranged essential reality of man is nothing but consciousness the thought of estrangement merely estrangement ’s abstract and therefore empty and unreal expression negation"
"The supersession of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract empty supersession of that empty abstraction the negation of the negation"
"The rich living sensuous concrete activity of self objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction absolute negativity an abstraction which is again fixed as such and considered as an independent activity as sheer activity"
"As a result therefore one gets general abstract forms of abstraction pertaining to every content and on that account indifferent to and consequently valid for all content the thought forms or logical categories torn from real mind and from real nature"
"We shall unfold the logical content of absolute negativity further on"
"| Hegel ’s positive achievement here in his speculative logic is that the definite concepts the universal fixed thought forms in their independence vis à vis nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human being and therefore also of a human thought and that Hegel has therefore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction process"
"For example superseded being is essence superseded essence is concept the concept superseded is absolute idea"
"But what then is the absolute idea"
"But abstraction comprehending itself as abstraction knows itself to be nothing it must abandon itself abandon abstraction and so it arrives at an entity which is its exact opposite at nature"
"Thus the entire logic is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself that the absolute idea is nothing for itself that only nature is something"
"The absolute idea the abstract idea which"
"considered with regard to its unity with itself is intuiting Logic 244 and which loc cit"
"in its own absolute truth resolves to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterisation and other being the immediate idea as its reflection go forth freely from itself as nature loc"
"this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and bizarre way and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches is from beginning to end nothing else but abstraction i.e. the abstract thinker which made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth resolves under various false and themselves still abstract conditions to abandon itself and to replace its self absorption nothingness generality and indeterminateness by its other being the particular and the determinate resolves to let nature which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction as a thought entity go forth freely from itself that is to say this idea resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature free of abstraction"
"The abstract idea which without mediation becomes intuiting is indeed nothing else but abstract thinking that gives itself up and resolves on intuition"
"This entire transition from logic to natural philosophy is nothing else but the transition so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker who therefore describes it in such an adventurous way from abstracting to intuiting"
"The mystical feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is boredom the longing for content"
"The man estranged from himself"
"is also the thinker estranged from his essence that is from the natural and human essence"
"His thoughts are therefore fixed mental forms dwelling outside nature and man"
"Hegel has locked up all these fixed mental forms together in his logic interpreting each of them first as negation that is as an alienation of human thought and then as negation of the negation"
"that is as a superseding of this alienation as a real expression of human thought"
"But as this still takes place within the confines of the estrangement this negation of the negation is in part the restoring of these fixed forms in their estrangement in part a stopping at the last act the act of self reference in alienation as the true mode of being of these fixed mental forms"
"This means that what Hegel does is to put in place of these fixed abstractions the act of abstraction which revolves in its own circle"
"We must therefore give him the credit for having indicated the source of all these inappropriate concepts which originally appertained to particular philosophers for having brought them together and for having created the entire compass of abstraction as the object of criticism instead of some specific abstraction"
"Why Hegel separates thought from the subject we shall see later at this stage it is already clear however that when man is not his characteristic expression can not be human either and so neither could thought be grasped as an expression of man as a human and natural subject endowed with eyes ears etc and living in society in the world and in nature"
"and in part to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself there makes its appearance in Hegel in the form of the resolution to recognise nature as the essential being and to go over to intuition the abandonment of abstract thought the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought of thought sans eyes sans teeth sans ears sans everything"
"It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting intuits nature abstractly"
"Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea in the form of a thought entity in a shape which was obscure and enigmatic even to him so by letting it emerge from himself he has really let emerge only this abstract nature only nature as a thought entity but now with the significance that it is the other being of thought that it is real intuited nature nature distinguished from abstract thought"
"Or to talk in human language the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing from pure abstraction the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought for ever shuttling back and forth in itself and never looking outward into reality are nothing else but abstractions from characteristics of nature"
"He once more resolves nature into these abstractions"
"Let us consider for a moment"
"Hegel ’s characteristics of nature and the transition from nature to the mind"
"Nature has resulted as the idea in the form of the other being"
"Since the i d is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of creating his abstraction"
"Thus for example time equals negativity referred to itself Hegel Encyclopädie"
"To the superseded becoming as being there corresponds in natural form superseded movement as matter"
"Light is reflection in itself the natural form"
"Body as moon and comet is the natural form of the antithesis which according to logic is on the one side the positive resting on itself and on the other side the negative resting on itself"
"The earth is the natural form of the logical ground as the negative unity of the antithesis etc"
"Nature as nature that is to say insofar as it is still sensuously distinguished from that secret sense hidden within it nature isolated distinguished from these abstractions is nothing a nothing proving itself to be nothing is devoid of sense or has only the sense of being an externality which has to be annulled"
"In the finite teleological position is to be found the correct premise that nature does not contain within itself the absolute purpose"
"Its purpose is the confirmation of abstraction"
"Nature has shown itself to be the idea in the form of other being"
"Since the idea is in this form the negative of itself or external to itself nature is not just relatively external vis à vis this idea but externality constitutes the form in which it exists as nature"
"Externality here is not to be understood as the world of sense which manifests itself and is accessible to the light to the man endowed with senses"
"It is to be taken here in the sense of alienation of a mistake a defect which ought not to be"
"For what is true is still the idea"
"Nature is only the form of the idea ’s other being"
"And since abstract thought is the essence that which is external to it is by its essence something merely external"
"The abstract thinker recognises at the same time that sensuousness externality in contrast to thought shuttling back and forth within itself is the essence of nature"
"||XXXIV| An entity which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself intrinsically has something outside itself which it lacks"
"That is its essence is different from it itself"
"For us mind has nature for its premise being nature ’s truth and for that reason its absolute prius"
"In this truth nature has vanished and mind has resulted as the idea arrived at being for itself the object of which as well as the subject is the concept"
"This identity is absolute negativity for whereas in nature the concept has its perfect external objectivity this its alienation has been superseded and in this alienation the concept has become identical with itself"
"But it is this identity therefore only in being a return out of nature"
"As the abstract idea revelation is unmediated transition to the coming to be of nature as the revelation of the mind which is free it is the positing of nature as the mind ’s world a positing which being reflection is at the same time a presupposing of the world as independently existing nature"
"Revelation in conception is the creation of nature as the mind ’s being in which the mind procures the affirmation and the truth of its freedom"
"The absolute is mind"
"Preface and Table of Contents Marx Engels Internet Archive"
"A few months ago while passing through Bruckberg Dr. Ruge informed you of our plan to publish Franco German Jahrb � cher and asked at the same time for your collaboration"
"Before I leave for Paris in a few days time I feel obliged to make a brief epistolary approach to you since I have not had the privilege of making your personal acquaintance"
"You were one of the first writers who expressed the need for a Franco German scientific alliance"
"You will therefore assuredly be one of the first to support an enterprise aimed at bringing such an alliance into being"
"For German and French articles are to be published promiscue in the Jahrb � cher"
"The best Paris writers have agreed to cooperate"
"Any contribution from you will be most welcome and there is probably something at your disposal that you have already written"
"From your preface to the 2nd edition of Das Wesen des Christenthums I am almost led to conclude that you are engaged on a fuller work on Schelling or that you have something about this windbag in mind"
"Now that would be a marvellous beginning"
"Schelling as you know is the 38th member of the German Confederation"
"The entire German police is at his disposal as I myself once experienced when I was editor of the Rheinische Zeitung"
"That is a censorship order can prevent anything against the holy Schelling indecipherable word here from getting through"
"Hence it is almost impossible in Germany to attack Schelling except in books of over 21 sheets and books of over 21 sheets are not books read by the people"
"Kapp 's book is very commendable but it is too circumstantial and rather inaptly separates judgment from facts"
"Moreover our governments have found a means of making such works ineffective"
"They must not be mentioned"
"They are ignored or the few official reviews dismiss them with a few contemptuous words"
"The great Schelling himself pretends he knows nothing about these attacks"
"His vanity will not be able to restrain itself this will wound the Prussian Government to the quick it will be an attack on Schelling 's sovereignty abroad and a vain monarch sets much greater store by his sovereignty abroad than at home"
"How cunningly Herr von Schelling enticed the French first of all the weak eclectic Cousin then even the gifted Leroux"
"For Pierre Leroux and his like still regard Schelling as the man who replaced transcendental idealism by rational realism abstract thought by thought with flesh and blood specialised philosophy by world philosophy"
"Schelling has not only been able to unite philosophy and theology but philosophy and diplomacy too"
"Thus an attack on Schelling is indirectly an attack on our entire policy and especially on Prussian policy"
"Schelling 's philosophy is Prussian policy sub specie philosophiae"
"You would therefore be doing a great service to our enterprise but even more to truth if you were to contribute a characterisation of Schelling to the very first issue"
"You are just the man for this because you are Schelling in reverse"
"The sincere thought we may believe the best of our opponent of the young Schelling for the realisation of which however he did not possess the necessary qualities except imagination he had no energy but vanity no driving force but opium no organ but the irritability of a feminine perceptivity this sincere thought of his youth which in his case remained a fantastic youthful dream has become truth reality manly seriousness in your case"
"Schelling is therefore an anticipated caricature of you and as soon as reality confronts the caricature the latter must dissolve into thin air"
"I therefore regard you as the necessary natural that is nominated by Their Majesties Nature and History opponent of Schelling"
"Your struggle with him is the struggle of the imagination of philosophy with philosophy itself"
"I confidently expect a contribution from you in the form you may find most convenient"
"My address is Herr M � urer"
"Although she does not know you my wife sends greetings"
"You would not believe how many followers you have among the fair sex"

"Since I just have the opportunity I take the liberty of sending you an article of mine in which some elements of my critical philosophy of law Contribution to the Critique of Hegel 's Philosophy of"
"I had already finished it once but have since revised it in order to make it more generally comprehensible"
"I do n't attribute any exceptional value to this essay"
"Your Philosophie der Zukunft and your Wesen des Glaubens in spite of their small size are certainly of greater weight than the whole of contemporary German literature put together"
"In these writings you have provided"
"I do n't know whether intentionally a philosophical basis for socialism and the Communists have immediately understood them in this way"
"The unity of man with man which is based on the real differences between men the concept of the human species brought down from the heaven of abstraction to the real earth what is this but the concept of society"
"Two translations of your Wesen des Christenthums one in English and one in French are in preparation and almost ready for printing"
"The first will be published in Manchester"
"Engels has been supervising it and the second in Paris the Frenchman Dr. Guerrier and the German Communist Ewerbeck have translated it with the help of a French literary expert"
"It is a remarkable phenomenon that in contrast to the eighteenth century religiosity has now passed to the middle and upper classes while on the other hand irreligiosity but an irreligiosity of men regarding themselves as men has descended to the French proletariat"
"The English proletarian is also advancing with giant strides but he lacks the cultural background of the French"
"But I must not forget to emphasise the theoretical merits of the German artisans in Switzerland London and Paris"
"The German artisan is still however too much of an artisan"
"But in any case it is among these barbarians of our civilised society that history is preparing the practical element for the emancipation of mankind"
"For me the difference between the French character and our German character was never demonstrated so sharply and convincingly as in a Fourierist work which begins with the following sentences"
"In his passions that man reveals himself completely"
"Has this ever happened to you"
"The main driving force of nature as of society is therefore the magical the passionate the non reflecting attraction and"
"everything which exists man plant animal or planet has received an amount of power corresponding to its mission in the system of the universe"
"From this there follows The attractive powers are proportional to the destinies"
"Do not all these sentences give the impression that the Frenchman has deliberately set his passion against the pure activity of German thought"
"One does not think in order to think etc"
"In his critical Berlin Literatur Zeitung Bruno Bauer my friend of many years standing but now rather estranged has provided fresh proof of how difficult it is for Germans to extricate themselves from the contrary one sidedness"
"I do n't know if you have read the journal"
"It contains much covert polemic against you"
"The character of the Literatur Zeitung can be reduced to the following Criticism is transformed into a transcendental being"
"These Berliners do not regard themselves as men who criticise but as critics who incidentally have the misfortune of being men"
"They therefore acknowledge only one real need the need of theoretical criticism"
"People like Proudhon are therefore accused of having made some practical need their point of departure"
"This criticism therefore lapses into a sad and supercilious intellectualism"
"Down with the object"
"This criticism thus regards itself as the only active element in history"
"It is therefore regarded as the greatest crime if the critic displays feeling or passion he must be an ironical ice cold sojoV. Sage"
"The critic should participate neither in the sufferings nor in the joys of society he should know neither friendship and love nor hate and envy he should be enthroned in a solitude where only the laughter of the Olympian Gods over the topsy turviness of the world resounds occasionally from his lips"
"The tone of Bauer 's Literatur Zeitung is therefore one of dispassionate contempt and he makes it all the easier for himself by flinging the results of your work and of our time as a whole at other people 's heads"
"He only exposes contradictions and satisfied with this occupation he departs with a contemptuous Hm"
"He declares that criticism does not give anything it is far too spiritual for that"
"Indeed he plainly expresses the hope"
"the time is not distant when the whole of degenerate mankind will rally against criticism and criticism means Bauer and company"
"It seems that Bauer has fought against Christ out of rivalry"
"I am going to publish a small booklet attacking this aberration of criticism"
"It would be of the greatest value to me if you would let me know in advance your opinion and in general some speedy sign of life from you would make me happy"
"The German artisans in Paris i. e. the Communists amongst them several hundreds have been having lectures twice a week throughout this summer on your Wesen des Christenthums from their secret leaders and have been remarkably responsive"

"Its immediate consequence trade like every activity is a direct source of gain for the trader"
"The next category to which trade gives rise is value"
"Abstract real value and exchange value"
"For Say utility is the determining feature of real value for Ricardo and Mill the cost of production"
"For the Englishmen competition as against the cost of production represents utility for Say it is the cost of production"
"Value is the ratio of the production costs to utility"
"Its immediate application the decision whether to produce at all whether utility outweighs the cost of production"
"The practical application of the concept of value is limited to the decision about production"
"The distinction between real value and exchange value is based on the fact that the equivalent given in trade is no equivalent"
"Price the relationship between cost of production and competition"
"Only that which can be monopolised has price"
"Ricardo 's definition of rent of land is incorrect because it presupposes that a fall in demand instantly reacts on rent and at once puts out of cultivation a corresponding quantity of the worst cultivated land"
"This definition leaves out competition that of Adam Smith leaves out fertility"
"Rent is the relationship between productivity of the soil and competition"
"The value of land Engels stipulates provided private property is abolished Ed"
"is to be measured by the productiveness of equal areas using equal amounts of labour"
"The separation of capital from labour"
"The division of profit into profit and interest"
"Profit the weight that capital puts in the scales when the costs of production are determined remains inherent in capital and the latter reverts to labour"

"The significance of wages"

"First published in Schweizerischer Republikaner Nos 39 41 46 and 51 May 16 and 23 and June 9 and 27 1843"
"The democratic party in England is making rapid progress"
"While Whiggism and Toryism the moneyed aristocracy and the landed aristocracy are engaged in a boring verbal battle over trifles in the national talkshop as the Tory Thomas Carlyle calls it or in the House which claims to represent the parishes of England as the Chartist Feargus O'Connor says while the Established Church exerts all its influence on the bigoted inclinations of the nation in order to maintain its decaying edifice a little longer while the Anti Corn Law League[138 squanders hundreds of thousands in the irrational hope to see in return millions flowing into the pockets of the cotton manufacturing lords during this time despised and derided socialism marches forward calmly and confidently and gradually compels the attention of public opinion"
"During this time too a new party of countless numbers has taken shape in a few years under the banner of the People ’s Charter[139 and has carried out such vigorous agitation that compared with it O'Connell and the League are bunglers and blunderers"
"It is well known that in England parties coincide with social ranks and classes that the Tories are identical with the aristocracy and the bigoted strictly orthodox section of the Church of England that the Whigs consist of manufacturers merchants and dissenters of the upper middle class as a whole that the lower middle class constitute the so called radicals and that finally Chartism has its strength in the working men the proletarians"
"Socialism does not form a closed political party but on the whole it derives its supporters from the lower middle class and the proletarians"
"Thus in England the remarkable fact is seen that the lower the position of a class in society the more uneducated it is in the usual sense of the word the more closely is it connected with progress and the greater is its future"
"In general this is a feature of every revolutionary epoch as was seen in particular in the religious revolution of which the outcome was Christianity blessed are the poor"
"Matthew 5:3 the wisdom of this world is foolishness 1 Corinthians 1:20 etc"
"But this portent of a great revolution has probably never been so clearly expressed and so sharply delineated as now in England"
"In Germany the movement proceeds from the class which is not only educated but even learned in England for three hundred years the educated and all the learned people have been deaf and blind to the signs of the times"
"Well known throughout the world is the pitiful routine of the English universities compared with which our German colleges are like gold but on the Continent people can not even imagine the kind of works produced by the foremost English theologians and even by some of the foremost English natural scientists and what miserable reactionary publications form the bulk of the weekly list of new books"
"Adam Smith ’s free trade has been pushed to the insane conclusions of the Malthusian theory of population and has produced nothing but a new more civilised form of the old monopoly system a form which finds its representatives among the present day Tories and which successfully combated the Malthusian nonsense but in the end arrived once more at Malthus conclusions"
"Everywhere there is inconsistency and hypocrisy while the striking economic tracts of the Socialists and partly also of the Chartists are thrown aside with contempt and find readers only among the lower classes"
"Strauss Das Leben Jesu was translated into English"
"Not a single respectable book publisher wanted to print it finally it appeared in separate parts 3d"
"per part and that was done by the publishing house of a minor but energetic antiquarian"
"The same thing occurred with translations of Rousseau Voltaire Holbach etc"
"Byron and Shelley are read almost exclusively by the lower classes no respectable person could have the works of the latter on his desk without his coming into the most terrible disrepute"
"It remains true blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and however long it may take the kingdom of this earth as well"
"This Bill has of course given rise to general commotion and has provided the parties with a fresh opportunity for testing their strength"
"The Whigs want to have the Bill rejected completely because it ousts the dissenters from the education of the young and by restricting the working hours of children causes difficulties for the manufacturers"
"Among the Chartists and Socialists on the other hand there is considerable agreement with the general humane tendency of the Bill except for the provisions relating to the High Church"
"Lancashire the main factory centre is also of course the main centre of agitation in regard to the Bill"
"Here the Tories are quite powerless in the towns moreover their meetings in this connection were not held in public"
"The congregations of the dissenters first of all met in order to put forward a petition against the Bill and then arranged for town meetings in alliance with the liberal manufacturers"
"A town meeting of this kind is summoned by the highest urban official is completely public and every inhabitant has the right to speak at it"
"Here therefore if the meeting hall is sufficiently large only the strongest and most energetic party can be victorious"
"And at all the town meetings so far convened the Chartists and Socialists have won"
"The second meeting was in Salford a sort of suburb of Manchester with a population of about 100,000 I attended it"
"The Whigs had taken every precaution to ensure victory for themselves"
"The borough reeve took the chair and talked a great deal about impartiality but when a Chartist asked whether a discussion would be allowed he was given the reply"
"It was intended to have the first resolution smuggled through but the Chartists were on the alert and prevented this"
"When one of the Chartists climbed on to the platform a clergyman dissenter came forward and tried to throw him off"
"However everything went well until finally a petition on Whig lines was proposed"
"Then a Chartist spoke and proposed an amendment thereupon the chairman and his whole retinue of Whigs rose and left the hall"
"But the meeting continued and the Chartist petition was put to the vote but police officers who had already intervened several times on the side of the Whigs put out the lights just at the right moment and forced the meeting to disperse"
"Nevertheless the Whigs caused all their resolutions to be published as carried in the next issue of the local newspaper and the borough reeve a was dishonest enough to sign his name on behalf of and on the instructions of the meeting"
"So much for Whig fairness"
"The third meeting took place two days later in Manchester and here the radical parties likewise achieved a most brilliant victory"
"Although the time was so chosen that the majority of the factory workers could not be present there was nevertheless a considerable majority of Chartists and Socialists in the hall"
"The Whigs confined themselves solely to the points which they had in common with the Chartists a Socialist and a Chartist spoke from the platform and bore witness that the Whigs on this occasion had behaved like good Chartists"
"The Socialist told them frankly that he had come with the intention of creating opposition if there was the slightest occasion for it but everything had gone according to his wishes"
"So it has turned out therefore that Lancashire and particularly Manchester the stronghold of Whiggism the centre of the Anti Corn Law League is able to show a brilliant majority in favour of radical democracy and thereby the power of the liberals is completely held in check"
"The Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung has a liberal correspondent in London who writes favourably about the manoeuvres of the Whigs in horribly long and boring articles"
"The Anti Corn Law League is now the power in the land declares this oracle and thereby utters the greatest lie ever told by a partisan correspondent"
"The League the power in the land"
"Where is this power"
"In it are Peel Graham and Gladstone the bitterest enemies of the League"
"But there every one of its proposals is rejected by a majority rarely equalled in the annals of the English Parliament"
"Where then is this power"
"In the public in the nation"
"This question can only be answered in the affirmative by such an empty headed frivolous correspondent for whom Drury Lane is the public and a drummed up meeting is public opinion"
"If this sagacious correspondent is so blind as to be incapable of seeing in broad daylight this is the legacy of the Whigs then I will tell him how matters stand with the power of the League"
"It has been driven out of the Ministry and Parliament by the Tories and out of public opinion by the Chartists"
"Feargus O'Connor has triumphantly routed it in all the towns of England everywhere he has challenged it to a public debate and the League has never picked up the gage"
"The League can not call a single public meeting without being most ignominiously trounced by the Chartists"
"Or does the Augsburg correspondent really not know that the pompous January meetings in Manchester and the meetings now being held in the Drury Lane theatre in London where the liberal gentlemen tell one another lies and try to deceive themselves about their inner instability"
"does he really not know these are whited sepulchres"
"Only members of the League or persons to whom the League gives tickets"
"Hence no hostile party can have a chance of successful opposition there and therefore no one applies for tickets"
"no matter what cunning it resorted to it could not manage to smuggle in even a hundred of its supporters"
"The League has been organising such meetings which are afterwards called public for some years past and at them it congratulates itself on its progress"
"Up to now the Chartists have shattered every public meeting of the League by a brilliant majority but the League has never been able to disrupt a Chartist meeting"
"Hence the League ’s hatred of the Chartists hence the clamour about the disorder caused by the Chartists at a meeting that is to say the rebellion of the majority against the minority which from the platform tries to make use of the majority for its own ends"
"Where then is the power of the League"
"In its imagination and in its purse"
"The League is wealthy by the abolition of the Corn Laws it hopes to conjure up a trade boom and therefore throws a sprat to catch a mackerel"
"But behind this glittering exterior there is nothing real"
"The National Charter Association the Chartists organisation 143 has a greater number of members and it will soon be seen that it can also collect more money although it consists only of poor workers while the League has all the rich manufacturers and merchants in its ranks"
"The Chartists can easily collect a million pennies 144 weekly it is very questionable whether the League could sustain this"
"The League opened a subscription list for � 50,000 and received about � 70,000"
"Feargus O'Connor is about to open a subscription list of � 125,000 for one project 145 and soon afterwards perhaps another for an equal amount he will certainly get it and what does the League then intend to do with its huge funds"
"Why the Chartists are in opposition to the League will be dealt with on another occasion"
"For the present only one further remark viz that the efforts and work of the League have one good side"
"This is the movement which is being aroused by the Anti Corn Law agitation in a hitherto entirely stable class of society the agricultural population"
"If an individual farmer wanted to come out against this traditional vote he found no support among his fellow farmers and the landlord could easily give him notice"
"Now however a considerable alertness among this class of the population is evident there already exist liberal farmers and among them there are people who realise that in very many cases the interests of the landlord and those of the tenant are directly opposed"
"Three years ago particularly in England herself no one could have said this to a tenant without being laughed at or even beaten up"
"Among this class the work of the League will bear fruit but quite certainly the fruit will be different from what the League expects for while it is probable that the mass of the tenants will gradually go over to the Whigs it is still more probable that the mass of the agricultural labourers will be impelled to take the side of the Chartists"
"One without the other is impossible and thus here too the League will obtain only feeble compensation for the decisive and total withdrawal from it of the working class which the League has suffered during the past five years in the towns and factory districts owing to Chartism"
"In view of these undeniable facts however I ask the correspondent of the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung Where is the power of the League"
"The English Socialists are far more principled and practical than the French which is especially due to the fact that they are engaged in an open struggle against the various churches and do not want to have anything to do with religion"
"In the larger towns they usually maintain a hall where every Sunday they listen to speeches which are often polemical against Christianity and atheistic but often also deal with some aspect of the workers life of their lecturers preachers"
"Watts in Manchester seems at any rate to be an outstanding man who has written some very talented pamphlets on the existence of God and on political economy"
"The lecturers have a very good manner of arguing they always start out from experience and from verifiable or obvious facts and at the same time the exposition is carried out in such a systematic way that it is very difficult to fight them on the ground they have chosen"
"If anyone tries to carry the argument into a different sphere they laugh in his face"
"If for example I say For man the existence of God does not depend on facts for its proof they retort What a ridiculous proposition you put forward if God does not manifest Himself through facts why should we want to trouble ourselves about Him"
"From your proposition it follows directly that it is a matter of indifference to people whether God exists or does not exist"
"And since we have thousands of other things to care about we leave to you the good God above the clouds where perhaps He exists or perhaps does not exist"
"What we do not know through facts does not concern us at all we keep to the basis of real facts where there can be no question of such fantastic things as God and religious theories"
"So the rest of their communist propositions are supported by proof based on facts in accepting which they are indeed careful"
"The stubbornness of these people is indescribable and how the clergy are going to win them over heaven alone knows"
"In Manchester for instance the communist community has 8,000 members openly registered at the hall and paying their subscriptions to it"
"The assertion that half of the working classes of Manchester share their views on property is no exaggeration because when Watts says from the platform for the Communists the platform is what the pulpit is for the Christians Today I am going to one or other meeting you can count on it that the motion put by the lecturer will have a majority"
"Of these theoreticians the most famous is Charles Southwell in Bristol who published a polemical journal"
"The Oracle of Reason and was punished for that by a year ’s imprisonment and a fine of about � 100"
"Of course the fine was quickly covered by subscriptions for every Englishman subscribes to his newspaper helps his leaders to pay fines pays for his chapel or hall attends his meetings"
"It was bought by a Christian denomination and converted into a chapel"
"When this new chapel was consecrated the Socialists and Chartists crowded into it to see and hear the ceremony"
"But when the clergyman began to praise God that all the wicked doings had been ended and that where formerly God had been defamed praises would now be sung to the Almighty they regarded this as an attack and since according to English notions every attack demands resistance they raised a shout of Southwell Southwell"
"Let Southwell speak in opposition"
"Southwell therefore got up and began to make a speech"
"Now however clergymen of the Christian denomination put themselves at the head of the columns of their parishioners and hurled themselves on Southwell other members of the denomination called in the police because Southwell was said to have disturbed a Christian religious service the clergymen laid hold of him struck him as often happens in such cases and handed him over to a policeman"
"Southwell himself ordered his supporters not to offer physical resistance when he was led away some 6,000 people followed him crying hurrah and cheering him"
"The founder of the socialist movement Owen writes in his numerous booklets like a German philosopher i.e. very badly but at times he has his lucid moments and then his obscure writings become readable moreover his views are comprehensive"
"According to Owen marriage religion and property are the sole causes of all the calamity that has existed since the world began"
"147 all his writings teem with outbursts of rage against the theologians lawyers and doctors all of whom he lumps together"
"The law courts are the seat of a class of people which is still completely theological and therefore prejudiced the laws also are imbued with theology and must therefore be abolished together with the jury"
"While the Church of England lived in luxury the Socialists did an incredible amount to educate the working classes in England"
"At first one can not get over one ’s surprise on hearing in the Hall of Science"
"the most ordinary workers speaking with a clear understanding on political religious and social affairs"
"but when one comes across the remarkable popular pamphlets and hears the lecturers of the Socialists for example Watts in Manchester one ceases to be surprised"
"The workers now have good cheap editions of translations of the French philosophical works of the last century chiefly Rousseau ’s Contrat social the Syst"
"� me de la Nature"
"148 and various works by Voltaire and in addition the exposition of communist principles in penny and twopenny pamphlets and in the journals"
"Furthermore there are also the Sunday lectures which are very diligently attended thus during my stay in Manchester I saw the Communist Hall which holds about 3,000 people crowded every Sunday and I heard there speeches which have a direct effect which are made from the special viewpoint of the people and in which witty remarks against the clergy occur"
"It happens frequently that Christianity is directly attacked and Christians are called our enemies"
"In their form these meetings partly resemble church gatherings in the gallery a choir accompanied by an orchestra sings social hymns these consist of semi religious or wholly religious melodies with communist words during which the audience stands"
"Then quite nonchalantly without removing his hat a lecturer comes on to the platform on which there is a table and chairs after raising his hat by way of greeting those present he takes off his overcoat and then sits down and delivers his address which usually gives much occasion for laughter for in these speeches the English intellect expresses itself in superabundant humour"
"In one corner of the hall is a stall where books and pamphlets are sold and in another a booth with oranges and refreshments where everyone can obtain what he needs or to which he can withdraw if the speech bores him"
"From time to time tea parties are arranged on Sunday evenings at which people of both sexes of all ages and classes sit together and partake of the usual supper of tea and sandwiches on working days dances and concerts are often held in the hall where people have a very jolly time the hall also has a caf �"
"How does it happen that all this kind of thing is tolerated"
"Firstly under the Whig Ministry the Communists secured the passage of an Act of Parliament and in general achieved such a strong position at that time that now as being a corporation it is no longer possible to take any steps against them"
"Secondly the authorities would very much like to attack prominent individuals but they know that this would only redound to the advantage of the Socialists by drawing public attention to them which is what the Socialists want"
"If they were to become martyrs for their cause and how many of them would be ready for that at any time it would give rise to agitation"
"But agitation is a means of making their cause still more widely known whereas at present a large part of the nation takes no notice of them regarding them as a sect like any other"
"The Whigs knew very well that repressive measures have a stronger effect in favour of a cause than agitation for the cause itself and hence they gave the Communists an opportunity to exist and take form but every form is a bond"
"The Tories on the other hand take some action against them when the atheistic publications seem too outrageous but every time it is to the advantage of the Communists"
"In December 1840 Southwell and others were punished for blasphemy immediately three new periodicals appeared one was The Atheist another The Atheist and Republican and the third published by the lecturer Watts The Blasphemer"
"A few issues of The Blasphemer caused a great sensation and the authorities tried in vain to discover how this trend could be suppressed"
"They left it alone and lo and behold all three papers ceased to exist"
"Thus everything here displays life and cohesion a solid basis and action thus everything here is assuming a definite external shape whereas we imagine that we know something if we have swallowed the dull miserable contents of Stein ’s book Lorenz von Stein Der Socialismus und Communismus des heutigen Frankreichs or that we are of some importance if somewhere or other"
"we utter an opinion perfumed with attar of roses"
"I almost called them lads which however is so far removed from weakness that they laugh at the mere Republicans because a republic would be just as hypocritical just as theological just as unjust in its laws as a monarchy but for the reform of society they are ready to sacrifice their worldly goods and life itself together with their wives and children"
"149 O'Connell the cunning old lawyer who during the Whig government sat calmly in the House of Commons and helped to pass liberal measures in order to be rejected by the House of Lords O'Connell has suddenly left London and absented himself from the parliamentary debates and is now raising again his old question of repeal"
"No one was thinking about it any more and then Old Dan Daniel O'Connell turns up in Dublin and is again raking up the stale obsolete lumber"
"It is not surprising that the old yeast is now producing remarkable air bubbles"
"How much could have been done if a sensible man possessed O'Connell ’s popularity or if O'Connell had a little more understanding"
"People who have nothing to lose two thirds of whom are clothed in rags genuine proletarians and sansculottes and moreover Irishmen wild headstrong fanatical Gaels"
"One who has never seen Irishmen can not know them"
"Give me two hundred thousand Irishmen and I will overthrow the entire British monarchy"
"The Irishman is a carefree cheerful potato eating child of nature"
"From his native heath where he grew up under a broken down roof on weak tea and meagre food he is suddenly thrown into our civilisation"
"Hunger drives him to England"
"In the mechanical egoistic ice cold hurly burly of the English factory towns his passions are aroused"
"What does this raw young fellow whose youth was spent playing on moors and begging at the roadside know of thrift"
"He squanders what he earns then he starves until the next pay day or until he again finds work"
"He is accustomed to going hungry"
"Then he goes back seeks out the members of his family on the road where they had scattered in order to beg from time to time assembling again around the teapot which the mother carries with her"
"But in England the Irishman saw a great deal he attended public meetings and workers associations he knows what Repeal is and what Sir Robert Peel stands for he quite certainly has often had fights with the police and could tell you a great deal about the heartlessness and disgraceful behaviour of the Peelers the police"
"He has also heard a lot about Daniel O'Connell"
"Now he once more returns to his old cottage with its bit of land for potatoes"
"The potatoes are ready for harvesting he digs them up and now he has something to live on during the winter"
"Good God where ’s the money to come from"
"The principal tenant is responsible to the landowner for the rent and therefore has his property attached"
"The Irishman offers resistance and is thrown into gaol"
"Finally he is set free"
"again and soon afterwards the principal tenant or someone else who took part in the attachment of the property is found dead in a ditch"
"That is a story from the life of the Irish proletarians which is of daily occurrence"
"The half savage upbringing and later the completely civilised environment bring the Irishman into contradiction with himself into a state of permanent irritation of continually smouldering fury which makes him capable of anything"
"In addition he bears the burden of five centuries of oppression with all its consequences"
"Is it surprising that like any other half savage he strikes out blindly and furiously on every opportunity that his eyes burn with a perpetual thirst for revenge a destructive fury for which it is altogether a matter of indifference what it is directed against so long as it can strike out and destroy"
"But that is not all"
"The violent national hatred of the Gaels against the Saxons the orthodox Catholic fanaticism fostered by the clergy against Protestant episcopal arrogance with these elements anything can be accomplished"
"And all these elements are in O'Connell ’s hands"
"And what a multitude of people are at his disposal"
"A triumphal procession lasting a fortnight a triumphal procession such as no Roman emperor ever had"
"And if O'Connell really had the welfare of the people in view if he were really concerned to abolish poverty if his miserable petty juste milieu aims were not behind all the clamour and the agitation for Repeal I should truly like to know what Sir Robert Peel could refuse him if he demanded it while at the head of such a force as he now has"
"But what does he achieve with all millions of valiant and desperate Irishmen"
"accomplish even the wretched Repeal of the solely because he is not serious about it because he is misusing the impoverished oppressed Irish people in order to embarrass the Tory Ministers and to put back into office his juste milieu friends"
"Sir Robert Peel too knows this well enough and hence 25,000 soldiers are quite enough to keep all Ireland in check"
"If O'Connell were really the man of the people if he had sufficient courage and were not himself afraid of the people i.e. if he were not a double faced Whig but an upright consistent democrat then the last English soldier would have left Ireland long since there would no longer be any idle Protestant priest in purely Catholic districts or any Old Norman baron in his castle"
"But there is the rub"
"If the people were to be set free even for a moment then Daniel O'Connell and his moneyed aristocrats would soon be just as much left high and dry as he wants to leave the Tories high and dry"
"That is the reason for Daniel ’s close association with the Catholic clergy that is why he warns his Irishmen against dangerous socialism that is why he rejects the support offered by the Chartists 151 although for appearances sake he now and again talks about democracy just as Louis Philippe in his day talked about Republican institutions and that is why he will never succeed in achieving anything but the political education of the Irish people which in the long run is to no one more dangerous than to himself"

"according to the newspaper"
"It has always been in some degree surprising to me ever since I met with English Socialists to find that most of them are very little acquainted with the social movement going on in different parts of the continent"
"And yet there are more than half a million of Communists in France not taking into account the Fourierists and other less radical Social reformers there are Communist associations in every part of Switzerland sending forth missionaries to Italy Germany and even Hungary and German philosophy after a long and troublesome circuit has at last settled upon Communism"
"Thus the three great and civilised countries of Europe England France and Germany have all come to the conclusion that a thorough revolution of social arrangements based on community of property has now become an urgent and unavoidable necessity"
"This result is the more striking as it was arrived at by each of the above nations independently of the others a fact than which there can be no stronger proof that Communism is not the consequence of the particular position of the English or any other nation but that it is a necessary conclusion which can not he avoided to be drawn from the premises given in the general facts of modern civilisation"
"It must therefore appear desirable that the three nations should understand each other should know how far they agree and how far they disagree because there must be disagreement also owing to the different origin of the doctrine of Community in each of the three countries"
"The English came to the conclusion practically by the rapid increase of misery demoralisation and pauperism in their own country the French politically by first asking for political liberty and equality and finding this insufficient joining social liberty and social equality to their political claims the Germans became Communists philosophically by reasoning upon first principles"
"This being the origin of Socialism in the three countries there must exist differences upon minor points but I think I shall be able to show that these differences are very insignificant and quite consistent with the best feeling on the part of the Social reformers of each country towards those of the other"
"The thing wanted is that they should know each other this being obtained I am certain they all will have the best wishes for the success of their foreign brother Communists"
"France is since the Revolution the exclusively political country of Europe"
"No improvement no doctrine can obtain national importance in France unless embodied in some political shape"
"It seems to be the part the French nation have to perform in the present stage of the history of mankind to go through all the forms of political development and to arrive from a merely political beginning at the point where all nations all different paths must meet at Communism"
"The development of the public mind in France shows this clearly and shows at the same time what the future history of the English Chartists must be"
"The French Revolution was the rise of democracy in Europe"
"Democracy is as I take all forms of government to be a contradiction in itself an untruth nothing but hypocrisy theology as we Germans call it at the bottom"
"Political liberty is sham liberty the worst possible slavery the appearance of liberty and therefore the reality of servitude"
"Political equality is the same therefore democracy as well as every other form of government must ultimately break to pieces"
"hypocrisy can not subsist the contradiction hidden in it must come out we must have either a regular slavery"
"that is an undisguised despotism or real liberty and real equality"
"I think I may be short upon the subject of Babouvism as the history of his conspiracy written by Buonarroti Ph"
"auquel elle donna lieu et des pi � ces justificatives etc has been translated into the English language"
"The Communist plot did not succeed because the then Communism itself was of a very rough and superficial kind and because on the other hand the public mind was not yet far enough advanced"
"The next French Social reformer was Count de Saint Simon"
"He succeeded in getting up a sect and even some establishments none of which succeeded"
"The general spirit of the Saint Simonian doctrines is very much like that of the Ham Common Socialists in England 154 although in the detail of the arrangements and ideas there is a great difference"
"The singularities and eccentricities of the Saint Simonians very soon became the victims of French wit and satire and everything once made ridiculous is inevitably lost in France"
"But besides this there were other causes for the failure of the Saint Simonian establishments all the doctrines of this party were enveloped in the clouds of an unintelligible mysticism which perhaps in the beginning attract the attention of the people but at last must leave their expectations disappointed"
"Their economical principles too were not unexceptionable the share of each of the members of their communities in the distribution of produce was to be regulated firstly by the amount of work he had done and secondly the amount of talent he displayed"
"A German Republican Boerne justly replied to this principle that talent instead of being rewarded ought rather to be considered as a natural preference and therefore a deduction ought to be made from the share of the talented in order to restore equality"
"Saint Simonism after having excited like a brilliant meteor the attention of the thinking disappeared from the Social horizon"
"Nobody now thinks of it or speaks of it its time is past"
"Nearly at the same time with Saint Simon another man directed the activity of his mighty intellect to the social state of mankind Fourier"
"Although Fourier ’s writings do not display those bright sparks of genius which we find in Saint Simon ’s and some of his disciples although his style is hard and shows to a considerable extent the toil with which the author is always labouring to bring out his ideas and to speak out things for which no words are provided in the French language nevertheless we read his works with greater pleasure and find more real value in them than in those of the preceding school"
"There is mysticism too and as extravagant as any but this you may cut off and throw it aside and there will remain something not to be found among the Saint Simonians scientific research cool unbiased systematic thought in short social philosophy whilst Saint Simonism can only be called social poetry"
"It was Fourier who for the first time established the great axiom of social philosophy that every individual having an inclination or predilection for some particular kind of work the sum of all these inclinations of all individuals must be upon the whole an adequate power for providing for the wants of all"
"From this principle it follows that if every individual is left to his own inclination to do and to leave what he pleases the wants of all will be provided for without the forcible means used by the present system of society"
"This assertion looks bold and yet after Fourier ’s mode of establishing it is quite unassailable almost self evident the egg of Columbus"
"Fourier proves that every one is born with an inclination for some kind of work that absolute idleness is nonsense a thing which never existed and can not exist that the essence of the human mind is to be active itself and to bring the body into activity and that therefore there is no necessity for making the people active by force as in the now existing state of society but only to give their natural activity the right direction"
"He goes on proving the identity of labour and enjoyment and shows the irrationality of the present social system which separates them making labour a toil and placing enjoyment above the reach of the majority of the labourers he shows further how under rational arrangements labour may be made what it is intended to be an enjoyment leaving every one to follow his own inclinations"
"I can not of course follow Fourier through the whole of his theory of free labour and I think this will be sufficient to show the English Socialists that Fourierism is a subject well worthy of their attention"
"Another of the merits of Fourier is to have shown the advantages nay the necessity of association"
"There is one inconsistency however in Fourierism and a very important one too and that is his nonabolition of private property"
"In his Phalanst � res or associative establishments there are rich and poor capitalists and working men"
"The property of all members is placed into a joint stock the establishment carries on commerce agricultural and manufacturing industry and the proceeds are divided among the members one part as wages of labour another as reward for skill and talent and a third as profits of capital"
"Thus after all the beautiful theories of association and free labour after a good deal of indignant declamation against commerce selfishness and competition we have in practice the old competitive system upon an improved plan a poor law bastile on more liberal principles"
"Certainly here we can not stop and the French too have not stopped here"
"The progress of Fourierism in France was slow but regular"
"There are not a great many Fourierists but they count among their numbers a considerable portion of the intellect now active in France"
"Victor Consid � rant is one of their cleverest writers"
"I said before that everything claiming national importance in France must be of a political nature or it will not succeed"
"Saint Simon and Fourier did not touch politics at all and their schemes therefore became not the common property of the nation but only subjects of private discussion"
"We have seen how Babeuf ’s Communism arose out of the democracy of the first revolution"
"The second revolution of 1830 gave rise to another and more powerful Communism"
"The great week of 1830"
"That is from July 27 to August 20 the peak of the July revolution was accomplished by the union of the middle and working classes the liberals and the republicans"
"The working men got up several insurrections for the abolition of political monopoly and the establishment of a republic 157 but were always defeated the middle class having not only the army on their side but forming themselves the national guard besides"
"During this time 1834 or 1835 a new doctrine sprang up among the republican working men"
"They saw that even after having succeeded in their democratic plans they would continue to be the dupes of their more gifted and better educated leaders and that their social condition the cause of their political discontent would not be bettered by any political change whatsoever"
"They referred to the history of the great revolution and eagerly seized upon Babeuf ’s Communism"
"This is all that can with safety be asserted concerning the origin of modern Communism in France the subject was first discussed in the dark lanes and crowded alleys of the Parisian suburb Saint Antoine and soon after in the secret assemblies of conspirators"
"Those who know more about its origin are very careful to keep their knowledge to themselves in order to avoid the strong arm of the law"
"However Communism spread rapidly over Paris Lyons Toulouse and the other large and manufacturing towns of the realm various secret associations followed each other among which the Travailleurs Egalitaires or Equalitarian Working Men and the Humanitarians were the most considerable"
"The Equalitarians were rather a rough set like the Babouvists of the great revolution they purposed making the world a working man ’s community putting down every refinement of civilisation science the fine arts etc as useless dangerous and aristocratic luxuries a prejudice necessarily arising from their total ignorance of history and political economy"
"The Humanitarians 158 were known particularly for their attacks on marriage family and other similar institutions"
"Both these as well as two or three other parties were very short lived and the great bulk of the French working classes adopted very soon the tenets propounded by M. Cabet P � re Cabet Father C. as he is called and which are known on the continent under the name of Icarian Communism"
"This sketch of the History of Communism in France shows in some measure what the difference of French and English Communism must be"
"The origin of Social reform in France is a political one it is found that democracy can not give real equality and therefore the Community scheme is called to its aid"
"The bulk of the French Communists are therefore republicans besides they want a community state of society under a republican form of government"
"Now I do not think that the English Socialists would have serious objections to this because though they are more favourable to an elective monarchy I know them to be too enlightened to force their kind of government upon a people totally opposed to it"
"It is evident that to try this would involve this people in far greater disorders and difficulties than would arise from their own democratic mode of government even supposing this to be bad"
"But there are other objections that could be made to the French Communists"
"They intend overthrowing the present government of their country by force and have shown this by their continual policy of secret associations"
"Even the Icarians though they declare in their publications that they abhor physical revolutions and secret societies even they are associated in this manner and would gladly seize upon any opportunity to establish a republic by force"
"This will be objected to I dare say and rightly because at any rate secret associations are always contrary to common prudence inasmuch as they make the parties liable to unnecessary legal persecutions"
"I am not inclined to defend such a line of policy but it has to be explained to be accounted for and it is fully done so by the difference of the French and English national character and government"
"The English constitution has now been for about one hundred and fifty years uninterruptedly the law of the land every change has been made by legal means by constitutional forms therefore the English must have a strong respect for their laws"
"But in France during the last fifty years one forced alteration has followed the other all constitutions from radical democracy to open despotism all kinds of laws were after a short existence thrown away and replaced by others how can the people then respect their laws"
"And the result of all these convulsions as now established in the French constitution and laws is the oppression of the poor by the rich an oppression kept up by force how can it be expected that the oppressed should love their public institutions that they should not resort to the old tricks of 1792"
"They know that if they are anything they are it by meeting force by force and having at present no other means why should they hesitate a moment to apply this"
"My reply is because they dare not"
"If they did the first experiment would be put down by soldiers"
"And if they were suffered to do so it would be of no use to them"
"I always understood the Harmony Establishment to be only an experiment to show the possibility of Mr. Owen ’s plans"
"160 if put into practice to force public opinion to a more favourable idea of the Socialist schemes for relieving public distress"
"Well if that be the case such an experiment would be of no avail in France"
"Show the French not that your plans are practical because that would leave them cool and indifferent"
"Show them that your communities will not place mankind under an ironbound despotism as Mr. Bairstow the Chartist said in his late discussion with Mr. Watts"
"161 Show them that real liberty and real equality will be only possible under Community arrangements show them that justice demands such arrangements and then you will have them all on your side"
"But to return to the social doctrines of the Icarian Communists"
"Their holy book is the Voyage en Icarie"
"Travels in Icaria of Father Cabet who by the by was formerly Attorney General and Member of the Chamber of Deputies"
"The general arrangements for their Communities are very little different to those of Mr. Owen"
"They have embodied in their plans everything rational they found in Saint Simon and Fourier and therefore are very much superior to the old French Communists"
"Everything possible is done to secure the liberty of the individual"
"Punishments are to be abolished and to be replaced by education of the young and rational mental treatment of the old"
"It is however curious that whilst the English Socialists are generally opposed to Christianity and have to suffer all the religious prejudices of a really Christian people the French Communists being a part of a nation celebrated for its infidelity are themselves Christians"
"One of their favourite axioms is that Christianity is Communism le Christianisme c'est le Communisme"
"But all this shows only that these good people are not the best Christians although they style themselves so because if they were they would know the bible better and find that if some few passages of the bible may be favourable to Communism the general spirit of its doctrines is nevertheless totally opposed to it as well as to every rational measure"
"The rise of Communism has been hailed by most of the eminent minds in France Pierre Leroux the metaphysician George Sand the courageous defender of the rights of her sex Abb � de Lamennais author of the Words of a Believer F. R. de Lamennais Paroles d'un croyant 1833 and a great many others are more or less inclined towards the Communist doctrines"
"The most important writer however in this line is Proudhon a young man who published two or three years ago his work What is Property"
"Qu'est ce que la Propri � t �"

"La propri � t � c'est le vol Property is robbery"
"This is the most philosophical work on the part of the Communists in the French language and if I wish to see any French book translated into the English language it is this"
"The right of private property the consequences of this institution competition immorality misery are here developed with a power of intellect and real scientific research which I never since found united in a single volume"
"What we want is anarchy the rule of nobody the responsibility of every one to nobody but himself"
"Upon this subject I shall have to speak more when I come to the German Communists"
"I have now only to add that the French Icarian Communists are estimated at about half a million in number women and children not taken into account"
"A pretty respectable phalanx is n’t it"
"They have a monthly paper the Populaire edited by Father Cabet and besides this P. Leroux publishes a periodical the Independent Review in which the tenets of Communism are philosophically advocated"
"Germany had her Social Reformers as early as the Reformation"
"Soon after Luther had begun to proclaim church reform and to agitate the people against spiritual authority the peasantry of Southern and Middle Germany rose in a general insurrection against their temporal lords"
"Luther always stated his object to be to return to original Christianity in doctrine and practice the peasantry took exactly the same standing and demanded therefore not only the ecclesiastical but also the social practice of primitive Christianity"
"They conceived a state of villainy and servitude such as they lived under to be inconsistent with the doctrines of the Bible they were oppressed by a set of haughty barons and earls robbed and treated like their cattle every day they had no law to protect them and"
"if they had they found nobody to enforce it"
"Such a state contrasted very much with the communities of early Christians and the doctrines of Christ as laid down in the Bible"
"Therefore they arose and began a war against their lords which could only be a war of extermination"
"Thomas M � nzer a preacher whom they placed at their head issued a proclamation 162 full of course of the religious and superstitious nonsense of the age but containing also among others principles like these That according to the Bible no Christian is entitled to hold any property whatever exclusively for himself that community of property is the only proper state for a society of Christians that it is not allowed to any good Christian to have any authority or command over other Christians nor to hold any office of government or hereditary power but on the contrary that as all men are equal before God so they ought to be on earth also"
"These doctrines were nothing but conclusions drawn from the Bible and from Luther ’s own writings but the Reformer was not prepared to go as far as the people did notwithstanding the courage he displayed against the spiritual authorities he had not freed himself from the political and social prejudices of his age he believed as firmly in the right divine of princes and landlords to trample upon the people as he did in the Bible"
"Besides this he wanted the protection of the aristocracy and the Protestant princes and thus he wrote a tract against the rioters disclaiming not only every connection with them but also exhorting the aristocracy to put them down with the utmost severity as rebels against the laws of God"
"Kill them like dogs"
"The whole tract is written with such an animosity nay fury and fanaticism against the people that it will ever form a blot upon Luther ’s character it shows that if he began his career as a man of the people he was now entirely in the service of their oppressors"
"The insurrection after a most bloody civil war was suppressed and the peasants reduced to their former servitude"
"If we except some solitary instances of which no notice was taken by the public there has been no party of Social Reformers in Germany since the peasants war up to a very recent date"
"The public mind during the last fifty years was too much occupied with questions of either a merely political or merely metaphysical nature questions which had to be answered before the social question could be discussed with the necessary calmness and knowledge"
"Men who would have been decidedly opposed to a system of community if such had been proposed to them were nevertheless paving the way for its introduction"
"It was among the working class of Germany that Social Reform has been of late made again a topic of discussion"
"A great number of German workmen is thus continually going to and from Paris and must of course there become acquainted with the political and social movements of the French working classes"
"One of these men William Weitling a native of Magdeburg in Prussia and a simple journeyman tailor resolved to establish communities in his own country"
"This man who is to be considered as the founder of German Communism after a few years stay in Paris went to Switzerland and whilst he was working in some tailor ’s shop in Geneva preached his new gospel to his fellow workmen"
"He formed Communist Associations in all the towns and cities on the Swiss side of the lake of Geneva most of the Germans who worked there becoming favourable to his views"
"Having thus prepared the public mind he issued a periodical the Young Generation for a more extensive agitation of the country"
"This paper although written for working men only and by a working man has from its beginning been superior to most of the French Communist publications even to Father Cabet ’s Populaire"
"It shows that its editor must have worked very hard to obtain that knowledge of history and politics which a public writer can not do without and which a neglected education had left him deprived of"
"It shows at the same time that Weitling was always struggling to unite his various ideas and thoughts on society into a complete system of Communism"
"The Young Generation was first published in 1841 in the following year Weitling published a work Guarantees of Harmony and Liberty in which he gave a review of the old social system and the outlines of a new one"
"I shall perhaps some time give a few extracts from this book"
"Having thus established the nucleus of a Communist party in Geneva and its neighbourhood he went to Zurich where as in other towns of Northern Switzerland some of his friends had already commenced to operate upon the minds of the working men"
"He now began to organise his party in these towns"
"Under the name of Singing Clubs associations were formed for the discussion of Social reorganisation"
"At the same time Weitling advertised his intention to publish a book The Gospel of the Poor Sinners"
"But here the police interfered with his proceedings"
"In June last Weitling was taken into custody his papers and his book were seized before it left the press"
"The Executive of the Republic appointed a committee to investigate the matter and to report to the Grand Council the representatives of the people"
"This report has been printed a few months since"
"It appears from it that a great many Communist associations existed in every part of Switzerland consisting mostly of German working men that Weitling was considered as the leader of the party and received from time to time reports of progress that he was in correspondence with similar associations of Germans in Paris and London and that all these societies being composed of men who very often changed their residence were so many seminaries of these dangerous and Utopian doctrines sending out their elder members to Germany Hungary and Italy and imbuing with their spirit every workman who came within their reach"
"The report was drawn up by Dr. Bluntschli a man of aristocratic and fanatically Christian opinions and the whole of it therefore is written more like a party denunciation than like a calm official report"
"Communism is denounced as a doctrine dangerous in the extreme subversive of all existing order and destroying all the sacred bonds of society"
"The pious doctor besides is at a loss for words sufficiently strong to express his feelings as to the frivolous blasphemy with which these infamous and ignorant people try to justify their wicked and revolutionary doctrines by passages from the Holy Scriptures"
"Weitling and his party are in this respect just like the Icarians in France and contend that Christianity is Communism"
"The result of Weitling ’s trial did very little to satisfy the anticipations of the Zurich government"
"Although Weitling and his friends were sometimes very incautious in their expressions yet the charge of high treason and conspiracy against him could not be maintained the criminal court sentenced him to six months imprisonment and eternal banishment from Switzerland the members of the Zurich associations were expelled the Canton the report was communicated to the governments of the other Cantons and to the foreign embassies but the Communists in other parts of Switzerland were very little interfered with"
"The prosecution came too late and was too little assisted by the other Cantons it did nothing at all for the destruction of Communism and was even favourable to it by the great interest it produced in all countries of the German tongue"
"Communism was almost unknown in Germany but became by this an object of general attention"
"Besides this party there exists another in Germany which advocates Communism"
"The former being thoroughly a popular party will no doubt very soon unite all the working classes of Germany that party which I now refer to is a philosophical one unconnected in its origin with either French or English Communists and arising from that philosophy which since the last fifty years Germany has been so proud of"
"The political revolution of France was accompanied by a philosophical revolution in Germany"
"Fichte and Schelling commenced rebuilding and Hegel completed the new system"
"There has never been ever since man began to think a system of philosophy as comprehensive as that of Hegel"
"Logic metaphysics natural philosophy the philosophy of mind the philosophy of law of religion of history all are united in one system reduced to one fundamental principle"
"The system appeared quite unassailable from without and so it was it has been overthrown from within only by those who were Hegelians themselves"
"I can not of course give here a complete development either of the system or of its history and therefore must restrain myself to the following remarks"
"The progress of German philosophy from Kant to Hegel was so consistent so logical so necessary if I may say so that no other systems besides those I have named could subsist"
"There are two or three of them but they found no attention they were so neglected that nobody would even do them the honour to overthrow them"
"Hegel notwithstanding his enormous learning and his deep thought was so much occupied with abstract questions that he neglected to free himself from the prejudices of his age an age of restoration for old systems of government and religion"
"But his disciples had very different views on these subjects"
"Hegel died in 1831 and as early as 1835 appeared Strauss Life of Jesus the first work showing some progress beyond the limits of orthodox Hegelianism"
"Others followed and in 1837 the Christians rose against what they called the New Hegelians denouncing them as Atheists and calling for the interference of the state"
"The state however did not interfere and the controversy went on"
"At that time the New or Young Hegelians were so little conscious of the consequences of their own reasoning that they all denied the charge of Atheism and called themselves Christians and Protestants although they denied the existence of a God who was not man and declared the history of the gospels to be a pure mythology"
"It was not until last year in a pamphlet Frederick Engels Schelling and Revelation by the writer of these lines that the charge of Atheism was allowed to be just"
"But the development went on"
"The Young Hegelians of 1842 were declared Atheists and Republicans the periodical of the party the German Annals[Deutsche Jahrb �"
"cher f � r Wissenschaft und Kunst was more radical and open than ever before a political paper Rheinische Zeitung f � r Politik Handel und Gewerbe was established and very soon the whole of the German liberal press was entirely in our hands"
"We had friends in almost every considerable town of Germany we provided all the liberal papers with"
"A temporary relaxation of the censorship of the press added a great deal to the energy of this movement quite novel to a considerable part of the German public"
"Papers published under the authorisation of a government censor contained things which even in France would have been punished as high treason and other things which could not have been pronounced in England without a trial for blasphemy being the consequence of it"
"The movement was so sudden so rapid so energetically pursued that the government as well as the public were dragged along with it for some time"
"But this violent character of the agitation proved that it was not founded upon a strong party among the public and that its power was produced by the surprise and consternation only of its opponents"
"The governments recovering their senses put a stop to it by a most despotic oppression of the liberty of speech"
"Pamphlets newspapers periodicals scientific works were suppressed by dozens and the agitated state of the country soon subsided"
"It is a matter of course that such a tyrannical interference will not check the progress of public opinion nor quench the principles defended by the agitators the entire persecution has been of no use whatever to the ruling powers because if they had not put down the movement it would have been checked by the apathy of the public at large a public as little prepared for radical changes as that of every other country and if even this had not been the case the republican agitation would have been abandoned by the agitators themselves who now by developing farther and farther the consequences of their philosophy became Communists"
"The princes and rulers of Germany at the very moment when they believed to have put down for ever republicanism saw the rise of Communism from the ashes of political agitation and this new doctrine appears to them even more dangerous and formidable than that in whose apparent destruction they rejoiced"
"As early as autumn 1842 some of the party contended for the insufficiency of political change and declared their opinion to be that a Social revolution based upon common property was the only state of mankind agreeing with their abstract principles"
"The political paper of the party the Rhenish Gazette Rheinische Zeitung published some papers advocating Communism but without the wished for effect"
"Communism however was such a necessary consequence of New Hegelian philosophy that no opposition could keep it down and in the course of this present year the originators of it had the satisfaction of seeing one republican after the other join their ranks"
"Besides Dr. Hess one of the editors of the now suppressed Rhenish Gazette and who was in fact the first Communist of the party there are now a great many others as Dr. Ruge editor of the German Annals the scientific periodical of the Young Hegelians which has been suppressed by resolution of the German Diet 164 Dr. Marx another of the editors of the Rhenish Gazette George Herwegh the poet whose letter to the King of Prussia was translated last winter by most of the English papers 165 and others and we hope that the remainder of the republican party will by and by come over too"
"Thus philosophical Communism may be considered for ever established in Germany notwithstanding the efforts of the governments to keep it down"
"They have annihilated the press in their dominions but to no effect the progress parties profit by the free press of Switzerland and France and their publications are as extensively circulated in Germany as if they were printed in that country itself"
"All persecutions and prohibitions have proved ineffectual and will ever do so the Germans are a philosophical nation and will not can not abandon Communism as soon as it is founded upon sound philosophical principles chiefly if it is derived as an unavoidable conclusion from their own philosophy"
"And this is the part we have to perform now"
"Our party has to prove that either all the philosophical efforts of the German nation from Kant to Hegel have been useless worse than useless or that they must end in Communism that the Germans must either reject their great philosophers whose names they hold up as the glory of their nation or that they must adopt Communism"
"And this will be proved this dilemma the Germans will be forced into and there can scarcely be any doubt as to which side of the question the people will adopt"
"There is a greater chance in Germany for the establishment of a Communist party among the educated classes of society than anywhere else"
"The Germans are a very disinterested nation if in Germany principle comes into collision with interest principle will almost always silence the claims of interest"
"The same love of abstract principle the same disregard of reality and self interest which have brought the Germans to a state of political nonentity these very same qualities guarantee the success of philosophical Communism in that country"
"It will appear very singular to Englishmen that a party which aims at the destruction of private property is chiefly made up by those who have property and yet this is the case in Germany"
"We can recruit our ranks from those classes only which have enjoyed a pretty good education that is from the universities and from the commercial class and in either we have not hitherto met with any considerable difficulty"
"As to the particular doctrines of our party we agree much more with the English Socialists than with any other party"
"Their system like ours is founded upon philosophical principle they struggle as we do against religious prejudices whilst the French reject philosophy and perpetuate religion by dragging it over with themselves into the projected new state of society"
"Although our fundamental principles give us a broader base inasmuch as we received them from a system of philosophy embracing every part of human knowledge yet in everything bearing upon practice upon the facts of the present state of society we find that the English Socialists are a long way before us and have left very little to be done"
"I may say besides that I have met with English Socialists with whom I agree upon almost every question"
"I can not now give an exposition of this Communist system without adding too much to the length of this paper but I intend to do so some time soon if the Editor of the New Moral World G. A. Fleming will allow me the space for it"
"166 I therefore conclude by stating that notwithstanding the persecutions of the German governments I understand that in Berlin Mr. Edgar Bauer is being prosecuted for a Communist publication 167 and in Stuttgart another gentleman has been committed for the novel crime of Communist correspondence notwithstanding this I say every necessary step is taken to bring about a successful agitation for Social Reform to establish a new periodical and to secure the circulation of all publications advocating Communism"

"The associations of the working classes for the purpose of introducing practically the ideas of socialism or rather communism by means of revolutionary reform become daily more frequent and more dangerous"
"The governments are daily issuing decrees against the wandering customs of artisans and apprentices they especially prohibited their visiting Switzerland which is considered as the home of these revolutionary ideas"
"Several apostles of socialism have been arrested"
"In The New Moral World the following paragraph was added Several apostles of Socialism have been arrested but a better means than those of compulsion has been thought of it consists in the organisation of a great association for the purpose of bestowing sound instruction to the working classes by propagating useful lectures among them"

Weitling who was found guilty in the first instance of disaffection and sentenced to several months imprisonment and five years banishment first for having excited the people to revolt and secondly for having entered into secret associations 169 notwithstanding the laws of the country concerning refugees"

"Seeing the paper from the Times on the Communists in Germany republished in The New Moral World"
"The Times hitherto enjoyed on the continent the reputation of a well informed newspaper but a few more articles like that on German Communism must very soon destroy that opinion"
"Every one who has the slightest knowledge of the social movements in France and Germany must at once perceive that the author of the paper alluded to speaks of a subject of which he is thoroughly ignorant"
"He knows not even so much about it as would enable him to expose the weaker parts of the party he attacks"
"If he wanted to decry Weitling he could have found in his writings passages much more fitted for his purpose than those he translates"
"If he only would have given himself the trouble to read the report of the Zurich committee J. C. Bluntschli Die Kommunisten in der Schweiz nach den bei Weitling vorgefundenen Papieren which he professes to have read but evidently has not he would have found plenty of matter for slander lots of garbled passages collected expressly for the purpose"
"It is very curious after all that the Communists themselves must furnish their opponents with arms for the combat but standing upon the broad base of philosophical argument they can afford to do so"
"The correspondent of the Times begins by describing the Communist party as very weak in France and doubts whether the insurrection of 1839 in Paris 171 was got up by them or which he thinks very likely by the powerful republican party"
"My well informed informer of the English public do you consider a party very weak which numbers about half a million of adult males"
"Do you know that the powerful republican party in France is and has been these last nine years in a state of utter dissolution and increasing decay"
"Do you know that the National newspaper the organ of this powerful party has a more limited circulation than any other Paris paper"
"Must I a foreigner remind you of the republican subscription for the Irish repeal fund got up by the National last summer and amounting to less than one hundred pounds"
"although the republicans affected considerable sympathy for the Irish repealers?[172 Do you not know that the mass of the republican party the working classes have seceded from their richer partisans long since and not joined no established the Communist party long before Cabet commenced to advocate Communism"
"Do you not know that all the power of the French republicans consists in the reliance they have in the Communists who wish to see a republic established before they begin putting Communism into practice"
"It seems you are ignorant of all these things and yet you ought to know them in order to form a correct opinion of continental Socialism"
"As to the insurrection of 1839 I do not consider such things creditable to any party but I have it from parties actively engaged in this � meute that it was plotted and executed by the Communists.[173"
"The well informed correspondent goes on to state that"
"Fourier ’s and Cabet ’s doctrines seemed more to occupy the minds of some literary and scientific characters than to gain general favour with the people"
"Of Fourier this is true as I had occasion to show in a former number of this paper but Cabet"
"Cabet the author of almost nothing but small pamphlets Cabet who is always called Father Cabet a name not likely to be given by literary and scientific characters Cabet whose greatest fault is superficiality and want of regard for the just claims of scientific research Cabet the editor of a paper Le Populaire de 1841 calculated for the information of those who are able to read only that this man ’s doctrines should occupy the mind of a professor of the Parisian university like Michelet or Quinet whose boast is a deepness deeper than mysticism"
"It is too ludicrous"
"The correspondent then speaks of the celebrated German nocturnal meeting at Hambach and Steinholzli 174 and expresses his opinion"
"I hardly know where to begin in exposing the blunders of this sentence"
"Firstly nocturnal meetings are quite unknown on the continent we have no torch light Chartists or nocturnal Rebeccaite assemblages.[175"
"The Hambach meeting was held in open day under the eyes of the authorities"
"Secondly Hambach is a place in Bavaria and Steinholzli in Switzerland some hundred miles from Hambach yet our correspondent speaks of the Hambach and Steinholzli meeting"
"Thirdly these two meetings were separated by a considerable extent not only of space but of time also"
"The Steinholzli meeting took place several years after the other"
"Fourthly these meetings not only seemed but in reality did bear a merely political character they were held before the Communists appeared in the field"
"The sources from which our correspondent got his invaluable information were the report of the Zurich Commission the published and unpublished Communist writings discovered at the arrest of Weitling and personal inquiry"
"Now it is evident from the ignorance of our correspondent that he never read the report it is evident that published communistical writings could not be discovered at the arrest of anybody as the very fact of their publication destroys every possibility of a discovery"
"The attorney general of Zurich certainly would not boast of the discovery of books which every bookseller could have furnished him with"
"As to the unpublished writings for the suppression of which the prosecution was commenced the Zurich senators would have been inconsistent indeed had they as our correspondent appears to believe afterwards published them themselves"
"In fact in all the report of our correspondent there is nothing produced which he could have procured from this source and from that of personal inquiry if it be not the two novel facts that the German Communists got their doctrine chiefly from Cabet and Fourier whom they attack as our correspondent could have read in the same book from which he so extensively quotes Weitling ’s Guarantees Wilhelm Weitling"
"p. 228 and that they consider as their four evangelists Cabet Proudhon Weitling and and"
"Benjamin Constant the friend of Madame de Sta � l died long ago and never thought of anything connected with social reform"
"Evidently our correspondent means Consid � rant the Fourierist editor of the Phalange now the D �"
"mocratie Pacifique who is not at all connected with the Communists"
"and immediately after this assertion is given our correspondent cuts its throat by laying down in twelve paragraphs an outline of Weitling ’s proposed arrangements for a new social state which arrangements are altogether positive and do not even mention the destruction of the present social system"
"These extracts however are given in a very confused manner showing that our correspondent did in several cases fail to hit upon the vital point of the question and gave in its stead some rather insignificant details"
"Thus he omits to state the chief point in which Weitling is superior to Cabet namely the abolition of all government by force and by majority and the establishment in its stead of a mere administration organising the different branches of labour and distributing its produce he omits the proposal to nominate all officers of this administration and in every particular Branch not by a majority of the community at large but by those only who have a knowledge of the particular kind of work the future officer has to perform and one of the most important features of the plan that the nominators are to select the fittest person by means of some kind of prize essays without knowing the author of any of these essays the names to be sealed up and that paper only to be opened which contains the name of the successful competitor obviating by this all personal motives which could bias the minds of the electors"
"As to the remainder of the extracts from Weitling I leave it to the readers of this periodical to judge whether they contain such contemptible stuff as our correspondent thinks them to be or whether they do not advocate in most if not in all cases the same principles and proposals for the propagation of which this paper was established"
"At any rate if the Times should wish to comment again on German"
"Communism it would do well to provide another correspondent"

"The well known novel of Eug � ne Sue The Mysteries of Paris has made a deep impression upon the public mind especially in Germany the forcible manner in which this book depicts the misery and demoralisation falling to the share of the lower orders in great cities could not fail to direct public attention to the state of the poor in general"
"The Germans begin to discover as the Allgemeine Zeitung the Times of Germany says that the style of novel writing has undergone a complete revolution during these last ten years that instead of kings and princes who formerly were the heroes of similar tales it is now the poor the despised class whose fates and fortunes joys and sufferings are made the topic of romance they are finding out at last that this new class of novel writers such as G.

"Our readers are aware of the rapid progress in Germany of Republican and Communist principles which progress has of late excited unusual terror amongst the crowned brigands and their advisers of that great confederation of nations i.e. the German Confederation"
"Additional measures of repression are therefore being called into operation to check the growth of these dangerous doctrines particularly in Prussia"
"It appears that in the year 1834 a secret Conference of Plenipotentiaries was held at Vienna when a Protocol was agreed to but which has only recently been published imposing most absolute restrictions upon the press and proclaiming and enforcing the right divine of Princes over all legislative and other popular bodies whatsoever"

"Princes who are menaced on the part of their states by any infringement of the orders laid down by the decree of the Diet of 1832 are to dissolve these states and to obtain military aid in support from the rest of the confederation"

"Political economy came into being as a natural result of the expansion of trade and with its appearance elementary unscientific huckstering was replaced by a developed system of licensed fraud an entire science of enrichment"
"This political economy or science of enrichment born of the merchants mutual envy and greed bears on its brow the mark of the most detestable selfishness"
"People still lived in the naive belief that gold and silver were wealth and therefore considered nothing more urgent than the prohibition everywhere of the export of the precious metals"
"The nations faced each other like misers each clasping to himself with both arms his precious money bag eyeing his neighbours with envy and distrust"
"Every conceivable means was employed to lure from the nations with whom one had commerce as much ready cash as possible and to retain snugly within the customs boundary all which had happily been gathered in"
"If this principle had been rigorously carried through trade would have been killed"
"People therefore began to go beyond this first stage"
"They came to appreciate that capital locked up in a chest was dead capital while capital in circulation increased continuously"
"They then became more sociable sent off their ducats as call birds to bring others back with them and realised that there is no harm in paying A too much for his commodity so long as it can be disposed of to B at a higher price"
"On this basis the Mercantile System was built"
"The nations drew slightly nearer to one another concluded trade and friendship agreements did business with one another and for the sake of larger profits treated one another with all possible love and kindness"
"But in fact there was still the old avarice and selfishness and from time to time this erupted in wars which in that day were all based on trade jealousy"
"In these wars it also became evident that trade like robbery is based on the law of the strong hand"
"No scruples whatever were felt about exacting by cunning or violence such treaties as were held to be the most advantageous"
"For as it still subscribed to the dictum that gold and silver constitute wealth only such transactions as would finally bring ready cash into the country were considered profitable"
"To ascertain this exports were compared with imports"
"When more had been exported than imported it was believed that the difference had come into the country in ready cash and that the country was richer by that difference"
"The art of the economists therefore consisted in ensuring that at the end of each year exports should show a favourable balance over imports and for the sake of this ridiculous illusion thousands of men have been slaughtered"
"Trade too has had its crusades and inquisitions"
"The eighteenth century the century of revolution also revolutionised economics"
"But just as all the revolutions of this century were one sided and bogged down in antitheses just as abstract materialism was set in opposition to abstract spiritualism the republic to monarchy the social contract to divine right likewise the economic revolution did not get beyond antithesis"
"The premises remained everywhere in force materialism did not attack the Christian contempt for and humiliation of Man and merely posited Nature instead of the Christian God as the Absolute confronting Man"
"In politics no one dreamt of examining the premises of the state as such"
"It did not occur to economics to question the validity of private property"
"Therefore the new economics was only half an advance"
"It was obliged to betray and to disavow its own premises to have recourse to sophistry and hypocrisy so as to cover up the contradictions in which it became entangled so as to reach the conclusions to which it was driven not by its premises but by the humane spirit of the century"
"Thus economics took on a philanthropic character"
"It withdrew its favour from the producers and bestowed it on the consumers"
"It affected a solemn abhorrence of the bloody terror of the Mercantile System and proclaimed trade to be a bond of friendship and union among nations as among individuals"
"All was pure splendour and magnificence yet the premises reasserted themselves soon enough and in contrast to this sham philanthropy produced the Malthusian population theory the crudest most barbarous theory that ever existed a system of despair which struck down all those beautiful phrases about philanthropy and world citizenship"
"The premises begot and reared the factory system and modern slavery which yields nothing in inhumanity and cruelty to ancient slavery"
"Modern economics the system of free trade based on Adam Smith ’s Wealth of Nations reveals itself to be that same hypocrisy inconsistency and immorality which now confront free humanity in every sphere"
"But was Smith ’s system then not an advance"
"Of course it was and a necessary advance at that"
"It was necessary to overthrow the mercantile system with its monopolies and hindrances to trade so that the true consequences of private property could come to light"
"It was necessary for all these petty local and national considerations to recede into the background so that the struggle of our time could become a universal human struggle"
"It was necessary to carry the immorality contained in the old economics to its highest pitch by attempting to deny it and by the hypocrisy introduced a necessary result of that attempt"
"All this lay in the nature of the case"
"We gladly concede that it is only the justification and accomplishment of free trade that has enabled us to go beyond the economics of private property but we must at the same time have the right to expose the utter theoretical and practical nullity of this free trade"
"The nearer to our time the economists whom we have to judge the more severe must our judgment become"
"For while Smith and Malthus found only scattered fragments the modern economists had the whole system complete before them the consequences had all been drawn the contradictions came clearly enough to light yet they did not come to examining the premises and still accepted the responsibility for the whole system"
"The nearer the economists come to the present time the further they depart from honesty"
"This is why Ricardo for instance is more guilty than Adam Smith and McCulloch and Mill more guilty than Ricardo"
"Even the Mercantile System can not be correctly judged by modern economics since the latter is itself one sided and as yet burdened with that very system ’s premises"
"Only that view which rises above the opposition of the two systems which criticises the premises common to both and proceeds from a purely human universal basis can assign to both their proper position"
"It will become evident that the protagonists of free trade are more inveterate monopolists than the old Mercantilists themselves"
"It will become evident that the sham humanity of the modern economists hides a barbarism of which their predecessors knew nothing that the older economists conceptual confusion is simple and consistent compared with the double tongued logic of their attackers and that neither of the two factions can reproach the other with anything which would not recoil upon themselves"
"This is why modern liberal economics can not comprehend the restoration of the Mercantile System by List whilst for us the matter is quite simple"
"The inconsistency and ambiguity of liberal economics must of necessity dissolve again into its basic components"
"Just as theology must either regress to blind faith or progress towards free philosophy free trade must produce the restoration of monopolies on the one hand and the abolition of private property on the other"
"The only positive advance which liberal economics has made is the elaboration of the laws of private property"
"These are contained in it at any rate although not yet fully elaborated and clearly expressed"
"It follows that on all points where it is a question of deciding which is the shortest road to wealth i. e. in all strictly economic controversies the protagonists of free trade have right on their side"
"That is needless to say in controversies with the monopolists not with the opponents of private property for the English Socialists have long since proved both practically and theoretically that the latter are in a position to settle economic questions more correctly even from an economic point of view"
"In the critique of political economy therefore we shall examine the basic categories uncover the contradiction introduced by the free trade system and bring out the consequences of both sides of the contradiction"
"The term national wealth has only arisen as a result of the liberal economists passion for generalisation"
"As long as private property exists this term has no meaning"
"The national wealth of the English is very great and yet they are the poorest people under the sun"
"One must either discard this term completely or accept such premises as give it meaning"
"Similarly with the terms national economy and political or public economy"
"In the present circumstances that science ought to be called private economy for its public connections exist only for the sake of private property"
"The immediate consequence of private property is trade exchange of reciprocal requirements buying and selling"
"In every purchase and sale therefore two men with diametrically opposed interests confront each other"
"The confrontation is decidedly antagonistic for each knows the intentions of the other knows that they are opposed to his own"
"Therefore the first consequence is mutual mistrust on the one hand and the justification of this mistrust the application of immoral means to attain an immoral end on the other"
"Thus the first maxim in trade is secretiveness the concealment of everything which might reduce the value of the article in question"
"The result is that in trade it is permitted to take the utmost advantage of the ignorance the trust of the opposing party and likewise to impute qualities to one ’s commodity which it does not possess"
"In a word trade is legalised fraud"
"Any merchant who wants to give truth its due can bear me witness that actual practice conforms with this theory"
"The Mercantile System still had a certain artless Catholic candour and did not in the least conceal the immoral nature of trade"
"We have seen how it openly paraded its mean avarice"
"Public opinion had not yet become humanised"
"Why therefore conceal things which resulted from the inhuman hostile nature of trade itself"
"But when the economic Luther Adam Smith criticised past economics things had changed considerably"
"The century had been humanised reason had asserted itself morality began to claim its eternal right"
"The extorted trade treaties the commercial wars the strict isolation of the nations offended too greatly against advanced consciousness"
"Smith proved that humanity too was rooted in the nature of commerce that commerce must become among nations as among individuals a bond of union and friendship instead of being the most fertile source of discord and animosity cf"
"Wealth of Nations Bk 4 Ch"
"3 � 2 that after all it lay in the nature of things for trade taken overall to be advantageous to all parties concerned"
"Smith was right to eulogise trade as humane"
"There is nothing absolutely immoral in the world"
"Trade too has an aspect wherein it pays homage to morality and humanity"
"The law of the strong hand the open highway robbery of the Middle Ages became humanised when it passed over into trade and trade became humanised when its first stage characterised by the prohibition of the export of money passed over into the Mercantile System"
"Then the Mercantile System itself was humanised"
"Naturally it is in the interest of the trader to be on good terms with the one from whom he buys cheap as well as with the other to whom he sells dear"
"A nation therefore acts very imprudently if it fosters feelings of animosity in its suppliers and customers"
"The more friendly the more advantageous"
"Such is the humanity of trade"
"Have we not overthrown the barbarism of the monopolies exclaim the hypocrites"
"Have we not carried civilisation to distant parts of the world"
"Have we not brought about the fraternisation of the peoples and reduced the number of wars"
"Yes all this you have done but how"
"You have destroyed the small monopolies so that the one great basic monopoly property may function the more freely and unrestrictedly"
"You have civilised the ends of the earth to win new terrain for the deployment of your vile avarice"
"You have brought about the fraternisation of the peoples but the fraternity is the fraternity of thieves"
"When have you done anything out of pure humanity from consciousness of the futility of the opposition between the general and the individual interest"
"When have you been moral without being interested without harbouring at the back of your mind immoral egoistical motives"
"By dissolving nationalities the liberal economic system had done its best to universalise enmity to transform mankind into a horde of ravenous beasts for what else are competitors"
"who devour one another just because each has identical interests with all the others after this preparatory work there remained but one step to take before the goal was reached the dissolution of the family"
"To accomplish this economy ’s own beautiful invention the factory system came to its aid"
"The last vestige of common interests the community of goods in the possession of the family has been undermined by the factory system and at least here in England is already in the process of dissolution"
"It is a common practice for children as soon as they are capable of work i.e. as soon as they reach the age of nine to spend their wages themselves to look upon their parental home as a mere boarding house and hand over to their parents a fixed amount for food and lodging"
"How can it be otherwise"
"What else can result from the separation of interests such as forms the basis of the free trade system"
"Once a principle is set in motion it works by its own impetus through all its consequences whether the economists like it or not"
"But the economist does not know himself what cause he serves"
"He does not know that with all his egoistical reasoning he nevertheless forms but a link in the chain of mankind ’s universal progress"
"He does not know that by his dissolution of all sectional interests he merely paves the way for the great transformation to which the century is moving the reconciliation of mankind with nature and with itself"
"The next category established by trade is value"
"There is no dispute between the old and the modern economists over this category just as there is none over all the others since the monopolists in their obsessive mania for getting rich had no time left to concern themselves with categories"
"All controversies over such points stem from the modern economists"
"The economist who lives by antitheses has also of course a double value abstract or real value and exchange value"
"There was a protracted quarrel over the nature of real value between the English who defined the costs of production as the expression of real value and the Frenchman Say who claimed to measure this value by the utility of an object"
"The quarrel hung in doubt from the beginning of the century then became dormant without a decision having been reached"
"The economists can not decide anything"
"The English McCulloch and Ricardo in particular thus assert that the abstract value of a thing is determined by the costs of production"
"Nota bene the abstract value not the exchangevalue the exchangeable value English term quoted by Engels"
"value in exchange that they say is something quite different"
"Why are the costs of production the measure of value"
"Because listen to this"
"because no one in ordinary conditions and leaving aside the circumstance of competition would sell an object for less than it costs him to produce it"
"What have we to do with selling here where it is not a question of value in exchange"
"So we find trade again which we are specifically supposed to leave aside and what trade"
"A trade in which the cardinal factor the circumstance of competition is not to be taken into account"
"First an abstract value now also an abstract trade a trade without competition i.e. a man without a body a thought without a brain to produce thoughts"
"And does the economist never stop to think that as soon as competition is left out of account there is no guarantee at all that the producer will sell his commodity just at the cost of production"
"Furthermore Let us concede for a moment that everything is as the economist says"
"Supposing someone were to make with tremendous exertion and at enormous cost something utterly useless something which no one desires is that also worth its production costs"
"Certainly not says the economist Who will want to buy it"
"So we suddenly have not only Say ’s much decried utility but alongside it with buying the circumstance of competition"
"It ca n’t be done the economist can not for one moment hold on to his abstraction"
"Not only what he painfully seeks to remove competition but also what he attacks utility crops up at every moment"
"Abstract value and its determination by the costs of production are after all only abstractions nonentities"
"But let us suppose once more for a moment that the economist is correct how then will he determine the costs of production without taking account of competition"
"When examining the costs of production we shall see that this category too is based on competition and here once more it becomes evident how little the economist is able to substantiate his claims"
"If we turn to Say we find the same abstraction"
"The utility of an object is something purely subjective something which can not be decided absolutely and certainly something which can not be decided at least as long as one still roams about in antitheses"
"According to this theory the necessities of life ought to possess more value than luxury articles"
"The only possible way to arrive at a more or less objective apparently general decision on the greater or lesser utility of an object is under the dominion of private property by competition and yet it is precisely that circumstance which is to be left aside"
"Thus here too the one side of the opposition passes over involuntarily into the other"
"Let us try to introduce clarity into this confusion"
"The value of an object includes both factors which the contending parties arbitrarily separate and as we have seen unsuccessfully"
"Value is the relation of production costs to utility"
"The first application of value is the decision as to whether a thing ought to be produced at all i.e. as to whether utility counterbalances production costs"
"Only then can one talk of the application of value to exchange"
"The production costs of two objects being equal the deciding factor determining their comparative value will be utility"
"This basis is the only just basis of exchange"
"But if one proceeds from this basis who is to decide the utility of the object"
"The mere opinion of the parties concerned"
"Then in any event one will be cheated"
"Or are we to assume a determination grounded in the inherent utility of the object independent of the parties concerned and not apparent to them"
"The practical application of the concept of value will then be increasingly confined to the decision about production and that is its proper sphere"
"But how do matters stand at present"
"We have seen that the concept of value is violently torn asunder and that each of the separate sides is declared to be the whole"
"So is mere subjective utility since no other kind of utility can exist at present"
"To help these lame definitions on to their feet it is in both cases necessary to have recourse to competition and the best of it is that with the English competition represents utility in contrast to the costs of production whilst inversely with Say it introduces the costs of production in contrast to utility"
"But what kind of utility what kind of production costs does it introduce"
"Its utility depends on chance on fashion on the whim of the rich its production costs fluctuate with the fortuitous relationship of demand and supply"
"The difference between real value and exchange value is based on a fact namely that the value of a thing differs from the so called equivalent given for it in trade i.e. that this equivalent is not an equivalent"
"This so called equivalent is the price of the thing and if the economist were honest he would employ this term for value in exchange"
"But he has still to keep up some sort of pretence that price is somehow bound up with value lest the immorality of trade become too obvious"
"This purely empirical law was the first to be discovered by the economist and from this law he then abstracted his real value i.e. the price at the time when competition is in a state of equilibrium when demand and supply cover each other"
"Then of course what remains over are the costs of production and it is these which the economist proceeds to call real value whereas it is merely a definite aspect of price"
"Thus everything in economics stands on its head"
"Value the primary factor the source of price is made dependent on price its own product"
"As is well known this inversion is the essence of abstraction on which see Feuerbach"
"According to the economists the production costs of a commodity consist of three elements the rent for the piece of land required to produce the raw material the capital with its profit and the wages for the labour required for production and manufacture"
"But it becomes immediately evident that capital and labour are identical since the economists themselves confess that capital is stored up labour"
"We are therefore left with only two sides the natural objective side land and the human subjective side labour which includes capital and besides capital a third factor which the economist does not think about I mean the mental element of invention of thought alongside the physical element of sheer labour"
"Have not all inventions fallen into his lap without any effort on his part"
"Has one of them cost him anything"
"Why then should he bother about them in the calculation of production costs"
"Science is no concern of his"
"What does it matter to him that he has received its gifts through Berthollet Davy Liebig Watt Cartwright etc gifts which have benefited him and his production immeasurably"
"He does not know how to calculate such things the advances of science go beyond his figures"
"But in a rational order which has gone beyond the division of interests as it is found with the economist the mental element certainly belongs among the elements of production and will find its place too in economics among the costs of production"
"And here it is certainly gratifying to know that the promotion of science also brings its material reward to know that a single achievement of science like James Watt ’s steam engine has brought in more for the world in the first fifty years of its existence than the world has spent on the promotion of science since the beginning of time"
"We have then two elements of production in operation nature and man with man again active physically and mentally and can now return to the economist and his production costs"
"What can not be monopolised has no value says the economist a proposition which we shall examine more closely later on"
"If we say has no price then the proposition is valid for the order which rests on private property"
"If land could be had as easily as air no one would pay rent"
"Since this is not the case but since rather the extent of a piece of land to be appropriated is limited in any particular case one pays rent for the appropriated i.e. the monopolised land or one pays down a purchase price for it"
"After this enlightenment about the origin of the value of land it is however very strange to have to hear from the economist that the rent of land is the difference between the yield from the land for which rent is paid and from the worst land worth cultivating at all"
"As is well known this is the definition of rent fully developed for the first time by Ricardo"
"This definition is indeed correct in practice if one presupposes that a fall in demand reacts instantaneously on rent and at once puts a corresponding amount of the worst cultivated land out of cultivation"
"This however is not the case and the definition is therefore inadequate"
"Moreover it does not cover the causation of rent and is therefore even for that reason untenable"
"In opposition to this definition Col T. P. Thompson the champion of the AntiCorn Law League revived Adam Smith ’s definition and substantiated it"
"According to him rent is the relation between the competition of those striving for the use of the land and the limited quantity of available land"
"Here at least is a return to the origin of rent but this explanation does not take into account the varying fertility of the soil just as the previous explanation leaves out competition"
"Once more therefore we have two one sided and hence only partial definitions of a single object"
"As in the case of the concept of value we shall again have to combine these two definitions so as to find the correct definition which follows from the development of the thing itself and thus embraces all practice"
"Rent is the relation between the productivity of the land the natural side which in turn consists of natural fertility and human cultivation"
"labour applied to effect improvement and the human side competition"
"He practices robbery in monopolising the land"
"He practices robbery in exploiting for his own benefit the increase in population which increases competition and thus the value of his estate in turning into a source of personal advantage that which has not been his own doing that which is his by sheer accident"
"He practices robbery in leasing his land when he eventually seizes for himself the improvements effected by his tenant"
"This is the secret of the ever increasing wealth of the big landowners"
"The first excludes the duty of feeding children the second deprives each generation of the right to live since each generation starts with what it inherits from the preceding generation"
"These axioms are rather consequences of private property"
"One should either put into effect the consequences or abandon private property as a premise"
"Indeed the original act of appropriation itself is justified by the assertion of the still earlier existence of common property rights"
"Thus wherever we turn private property leads us into contradictions"
"To make land an object of huckstering the land which is our one and all the first condition of our existence was the last step towards making oneself an object of huckstering"
"It was and is to this very day an immorality surpassed only by the immorality of self alienation"
"And the original appropriation the monopolisation of the land by a few the exclusion of the rest from that which is the condition of their life yields nothing in immorality to the subsequent huckstering of the land"
"If here again we abandon private property rent is reduced to its truth to the rational notion which essentially lies at its root"
"The value of the land divorced from it as rent then reverts to the land itself"
"This value to be measured by the productivity of equal areas of land subjected to equal applications of labour is indeed taken into account as part of the production costs when determining the value of products and like rent it is the relation of productivity to competition but to true competition such as will be developed when its time comes"
"We have seen that capital and labour are initially identical we see further from the explanations of the economist himself that in the process of production capital the result of labour is immediately transformed again into the substratum into the material of labour and that therefore the momentarily postulated separation of capital from labour is immediately superseded by the unity of both"
"And yet the economist separates capital from labour and yet clings to the division without giving any other recognition to their unity than by his definition of capital as stored up labour"
"The split between capital and labour resulting from private property is nothing but the inner dichotomy of labour corresponding to this divided condition and arising out of it"
"And after this separation is accomplished capital is divided once more into the original capital and profit the increment of capital which it receives in the process of production although in practice profit is immediately lumped together with capital and set into motion with it"
"Indeed even profit is in its turn split into interest and profit proper"
"In the case of interest the absurdity of these splits is carried to the extreme"
"The immorality of lending at interest of receiving without working merely for making a loan though already implied in private property is only too obvious and has long ago been recognised for what it is by unprejudiced popular consciousness which in such matters is usually right"
"All these subtle splits and divisions stem from the original separation of capital from labour and from the culmination of this separation the division of mankind into capitalists and workers a division which daily becomes ever more acute and which as we shall see is bound to deepen"
"This separation however like the separation already considered of land from capital and labour is in the final analysis an impossible separation"
"What share land capital and labour each have in any particular product can not be determined"
"The land produces the raw material but not without capital and labour"
"And labour presupposes at least land and usually also capital"
"The functions of these three elements are completely different and are not to be measured by a fourth common standard"
"Therefore when it comes to dividing the proceeds among the three elements under existing conditions there is no inherent standard it is an entirely alien and with regard to them fortuitous standard that decides"
"competition the cunning right of the stronger"
"Rent implies competition profit on capital is solely determined by competition and the position with regard to wages we shall see presently"
"If we abandon private property then all these unnatural divisions disappear"
"The difference between interest and profit disappears capital is nothing without labour without movement"
"Labour the main factor in production the source of wealth free human activity comes off badly with the economist"
"Just as capital has already been separated from labour so labour is now in turn split for a second time the product of labour confronts labour as wages is separated from it and is in its turn as usual determined by competition there being as we have seen no firm standard determining labour ’s share in production"
"If we do away with private property this unnatural separation also disappears"
"Labour becomes its own reward and the true significance of the wages of labour hitherto alienated comes to light namely the significance of labour for the determination of the production costs of a thing"
"We have seen that in the end everything comes down to competition so long as private property exists"
"It is the economist ’s principal category his most beloved daughter whom he ceaselessly caresses and look out for the Medusa ’s head which she will show you"
"The immediate consequence of private property was the split of production into two opposing sides the natural and the human sides the soil which without fertilisation by man is dead and sterile and human activity the first condition of which is that very soil"
"Furthermore we have seen how human activity in its turn was dissolved into labour and capital and how these two sides antagonistically confronted each other"
"the fragmentation of each of these elements"
"One piece of land stands confronted by another one capital by another one labourer by another"
"In other words because private property isolates everyone in his own crude solitariness and because nevertheless everyone has the same interest as his neighbour one landowner stands antagonistically confronted by another one capitalist by another one worker by another"
"In this discord of identical interests resulting precisely from this identity is consummated the immorality of mankind ’s condition hitherto and this consummation is competition"
"The opposite of competition is monopoly"
"Monopoly was the war cry of the Mercantilists competition the battle cry of the liberal economists"
"It is easy to see that this antithesis is again a quite hollow antithesis"
"Every competitor can not but desire to have the monopoly be he worker capitalist or landowner"
"Competition is based on self interest and self interest in turn breeds monopoly"
"In short competition passes over into monopoly"
"On the other hand monopoly can not stem the tide of competition indeed it itself breeds competition just as a prohibition of imports for instance or high tariffs positively breed the competition of smuggling"
"The contradiction of competition is exactly the same as that of private property"
"Thus the general and the individual interest are diametrically opposed to each other"
"The contradiction of competition is that each can not but desire the monopoly whilst the whole as such is bound to lose by monopoly and must therefore remove it"
"Moreover competition already presupposes monopoly namely the monopoly of property and here the hypocrisy of the liberals comes once more to light and so long as the monopoly of property exists for so long the possession of monopoly is equally justified for monopoly once it exists is also property"
"What a pitiful half measure therefore to attack the small monopolies and to leave untouched the basic monopoly"
"And if we add to this the economist ’s proposition mentioned above that nothing has value which can not be monopolised that nothing therefore which does not permit of such monopolisation can enter this arena of competition then our assertion that competition presupposes monopoly is completely justified"
"The law of competition is that demand and supply always strive to complement each other and therefore never do so"
"The two sides are torn apart again and transformed into flat opposition"
"Supply always follows close on demand without ever quite covering it"
"If demand is greater than supply the price rises and as a result supply is to a certain degree stimulated"
"As soon as it comes on to the market prices fall and if it becomes greater than demand then the fall in prices is so significant that demand is once again stimulated"
"So it goes on unendingly a permanently unhealthy state of affairs a constant alternation of over stimulation and flagging which precludes all advance a state of perpetual fluctuation without ever reaching its goal"
"This law with its constant adjustment in which whatever is lost here is gained there is regarded as something excellent by the economist"
"It is his chief glory he can not see enough of it and considers it in all its possible and impossible applications"
"Yet it is obvious that this law is purely a law of nature and not a law of the mind"
"It is a law which produces revolution"
"The economist comes along with his lovely theory of demand and supply proves to you that one can never produce too much and practice replies with trade crises which reappear as regularly as the comets and of which we have now on the average one every five to seven years"
"For the last eighty years these trade crises have arrived just as regularly as the great plagues did in the past and they have brought in their train more misery and more immorality than the latter"
"Compare Wade History of the Middle and Working Classes London 1835 p. 211"
"Of course these commercial upheavals confirm the law confirm it exhaustively but in a manner different from that which the economist would have us believe to be the case"
"What are we to think of a law which can only assert itself through periodic upheavals"
"It is certainly a natural law based on the unconsciousness of the participants"
"If the producers as such knew how much the consumers required if they were to organise production if they were to share it out amongst themselves then the fluctuations of competition and its tendency to crisis would be impossible"
"Carry on production consciously as human beings not as dispersed atoms without consciousness of your species and you have overcome all these artificial and untenable antitheses"
"But as long as you continue to produce in the present unconscious thoughtless manner at the mercy of chance for just so long trade crises will remain and each successive crisis is bound to become more universal and therefore worse than the preceding one is bound to impoverish a larger body of small capitalists and to augment in increasing proportion the numbers of the class who live by labour alone thus considerably enlarging the mass of labour to be employed the major problem of our economists and finally causing a social revolution such as has never been dreamt of in the philosophy of the economists"
"The perpetual fluctuation of prices such as is created by the condition of competition completely deprives trade of its last vestige of morality"
"It is no longer a question of value the same system which appears to attach such importance to value which confers on the abstraction of value in money form the honour of having an existence of its own this very system destroys by means of competition the inherent value of all things and daily and hourly changes the value relationship of all things to one another"
"Where is there any possibility remaining in this whirlpool of an exchange based on a moral foundation"
"In this continuous up and down everyone must seek to hit upon the most favourable moment for purchase and sale everyone must become a speculator that is to say must reap where he has not sown must enrich himself at the expense of others must calculate on the misfortune of others or let chance win for him"
"The speculator always counts on disasters particularly on bad harvests"
"He utilises everything for instance the New York fire December 16 1835 in its time and immorality ’s culminating point is the speculation on the Stock Exchange where history and with it mankind is demoted to a means of gratifying the avarice of the calculating or gambling speculator"
"And let not the honest respectable merchant rise above the gambling on the Stock Exchange with a Pharisaic"
"I thank thee O Lord etc"
"He is as bad as the speculators in stocks and shares"
"He speculates just as much as they do"
"He has to competition compels him to"
"And his trading activity therefore implies the same immorality as theirs"
"The community will have to calculate what it can produce with the means at its disposal and in accordance with the relationship of this productive power to the mass of consumers it will determine how far it has to raise or lower production how far it has to give way to or curtail luxury"
"But so that they may be able to pass a correct judgment on this relationship and on the increase in productive power to be expected from a rational state of affairs within the community I invite my readers to consult the writings of the English Socialists and partly also those of Fourier"
"Subjective competition the contest of capital against capital of labour against labour etc will under these conditions be reduced to the spirit of emulation grounded in human nature a concept tolerably set forth so far only by Fourier which after the transcendence of opposing interests will be confined to its proper and rational sphere"
"The struggle of capital against capital of labour against labour of land against land drives production to a fever pitch at which production turns all natural and rational relations upside down"
"No worker can hold his own against his competitors if he does not devote all his energy to labour"
"No one at all who enters into the struggle of competition can weather it without the utmost exertion of his energy without renouncing every truly human purpose"
"The consequence of this over exertion on the one side is inevitably slackening on the other"
"When the fluctuation of competition is small when demand and supply consumption and production are almost equal a stage must be reached in the development of production where there is so much superfluous productive power that the great mass of the nation has nothing to live on that the people starve from sheer abundance"
"For some considerable time England has found herself in this crazy position in this living absurdity"
"When production is subject to greater fluctuations as it is bound to be in consequence of such a situation then the alternation of boom and crisis overproduction and slump sets in"
"The economist has never been able to find an explanation for this mad situation"
"In order to explain it he invented the population theory which is just as senseless indeed even more senseless than the contradiction of coexisting wealth and poverty"
"The economist could not afford to see the truth he could not afford to admit that this contradiction is a simple consequence of competition for in that case his entire system would have fallen to bits"
"For us the matter is easy to explain"
"The productive power at mankind ’s disposal is immeasurable"
"The productivity of the soil can be increased ad infinitum by the application of capital labour and science"
"According to the most able economists and statisticians cf"
"Alison ’s Principles of Population Vol"
"I Chs 1 and 2 over populated Great Britain can be brought within ten years to produce a corn yield sufficient for a population six times its present size"
"Capital increases daily labour power grows with population and day by day science increasingly makes the forces of nature subject to man"
"Left to competition it does the same but within a context of antitheses"
"One part of the land is cultivated in the best possible manner whilst another part in Great Britain and Ireland thirty million acres of good land lies barren"
"One part of capital circulates with colossal speed another lies dead in the chest"
"One part of the workers works fourteen or sixteen hours a day whilst another part stands idle and inactive and starves"
"Or the partition leaves this realm of simultaneity today trade is good demand is very considerable everyone works capital is turned over with miraculous speed farming flourishes the workers work themselves sick"
"Tomorrow stagnation sets in"
"The cultivation of the land is not worth the effort entire stretches of land remain untilled the flow of capital suddenly freezes the workers have no employment and the whole country labours under surplus wealth and surplus population"
"The economist can not afford to accept this exposition of the subject as correct otherwise as has been said he would have to give up his whole system of competition"
"He would have to recognise the hollowness of his antithesis of production and consumption of surplus population and surplus wealth"
"To bring fact and theory into conformity with each other since this fact simply could not be denied the population theory was invented"
"Malthus the originator of this doctrine maintains that population is always pressing on the means of subsistence that as soon as production increases population increases in the same proportion and that the inherent tendency of the population to multiply in excess of the available means of subsistence is the root of all misery and all vice"
"For when there are too many people they have to be disposed of in one way or another either they must be killed by violence or they must starve"
"But when this has happened there is once more a gap which other multipliers of the population immediately start to fill up once more and so the old misery begins all over again"
"What is more this is the case in all circumstances not only in civilised but also in primitive conditions"
"In New Holland The old name for Australia"
"with a population density of one per square mile the savages suffer just as much from over population as England"
"In short if we want to be consistent we must admit that the earth was already over populated when only one man existed"
"The implications of this line of thought are that since it is precisely the poor who are the surplus nothing should be done for them except to make their dying of starvation as easy as possible and to convince them that it can not be helped and that there is no other salvation for their whole class than keeping propagation down to the absolute minimum"
"has suggested whereby each working class family would be allowed to have two and a half children any excess being painlessly killed"
"Charity is to be considered a crime since it supports the augmentation of the surplus population"
"Indeed it will be very advantageous to declare poverty a crime and to turn poor houses into prisons as has already happened in England as a result of the new liberal Poor Law"
"Admittedly it is true that this theory ill conforms with the Bible ’s doctrine of the perfection of God and of His creation but it is a poor refutation to enlist the Bible against facts"
"Am I to go on any longer elaborating this vile infamous theory this hideous blasphemy against nature and mankind"
"Am I to pursue its consequences any further"
"Here at last we have the immorality of the economist brought to its highest pitch"
"What are all the wars and horrors of the monopoly system compared with this theory"
"And it is just this theory which is the keystone of the liberal system of free trade whose fall entails the downfall of the entire edifice"
"For if here competition is proved to be the cause of misery poverty and crime who then will still dare to speak up for it"
"In his above mentioned work Alison has shaken the Malthusian theory by bringing in the productive power of the land and by opposing to the Malthusian principle the fact that each adult can produce more than he himself needs a fact without which mankind could not multiply indeed could not even exist if it were not so how could those still growing up live"
"But Alison does not go to the root of the matter and therefore in the end reaches the same conclusion as Malthus"
"True enough he proves that Malthus principle is incorrect but can not gainsay the facts which have impelled Malthus to his principle"
"If Malthus had not considered the matter so one sidedly he could not have failed to see that surplus population or labour power is invariably tied up with surplus wealth surplus capital and surplus landed property"
"The population is only too large where the productive power as a whole is too large"
"The condition of every over populated country particularly England since the time when Malthus wrote makes this abundantly clear"
"These were the facts which Malthus ought to have considered in their totality and whose consideration was bound to have led to the correct conclusion"
"Instead he selected one fact gave no consideration to the others and therefore arrived at his crazy conclusion"
"The second error he committed was to confuse means of subsistence with means of employment"
"But the means of employment are not the means of subsistence"
"Only in their end result are the means of employment increased by the increase in machin epower and capital"
"Here a new contradiction in economics comes to light"
"The economist ’s demand is not the real demand his consumption is an artificial consumption"
"For the economist only that person really demands only that person is a real consumer who has an equivalent to offer for what he receives"
"But if it is a fact that every adult produces more than he himself can consume that children are like trees which give superabundant returns on the outlays invested in them and these certainly are facts are they not then it must be assumed that each worker ought to be able to produce far more than he needs and that the community therefore ought to be very glad to provide him with everything he needs one must consider a large family to be a very welcome gift for the community"
"But the economist with his crude outlook knows no other equivalent than that which is paid to him in tangible ready cash"
"He is so firmly set in his antitheses that the most striking facts are of as little concern to him as the most scientific principles"
"We destroy the contradiction simply by transcending it"
"With the fusion of the interests now opposed to each other there disappears the contradiction between excess population here and excess wealth there there disappears the miraculous fact more miraculous than all the miracles of all the religions put together that a nation has to starve from sheer wealth and plenty and there disappears the crazy assertion that the earth lacks the power to feed men"
"This assertion is the pinnacle of Christian economics and that our economics is essentially Christian I could have proved from every proposition from every category and shall in fact do so in due course"
"The Malthusian theory is but the economic expression of the religious dogma of the contradiction of spirit and nature and the resulting corruption of both"
"Moreover I shall not accept as competent any defence of the Malthusian theory which does not explain to me on the basis of its own principles how a people can starve from sheer plenty and bring this into harmony with reason and fact"
"At the same time the Malthusian theory has certainly been a necessary point of transition which has taken us an immense step further"
"Thanks to this theory as to economics as a whole our attention has been drawn to the productive power of the earth and of mankind and after overcoming this economic despair we have been made for ever secure against the fear of overpopulation"
"We derive from it the most powerful economic arguments for a social transformation"
"For even if Malthus were completely right this transformation would have to be undertaken straight away for only this transformation only the education of the masses which it provides makes possible that moral restraint of the propagative instinct which Malthus himself presents as the most effective and easiest remedy for overpopulation"
"Through this theory we have come to know the deepest degradation of mankind their dependence on the conditions of competition"
"It has shown us how in the last instance private property has turned man into a commodity whose production and destruction also depend solely on demand how the system of competition has thus slaughtered and daily continues to slaughter millions of men"
"Yet so as to deprive the universal fear of overpopulation of any possible basis let us once more return to the relationship of productive power to population"
"Malthus establishes a formula on which he bases his entire system population is said to increase in a geometrical progression 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 etc"
"the productive power of the land in an arithmetical progression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6"
"The difference is obvious is terrifying but is it correct"
"Where has it been proved that the productivity of the land increases in an arithmetical progression"
"The extent of land is limited"
"The labour power to be employed on this land surface increases with population"
"Even if we assume that the increase in yield due to increase in labour does not always rise in proportion to the labour there still remains a third element which admittedly never means anything to the economist science whose progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population"
"What progress does the agriculture of this century owe to chemistry alone indeed to two men alone Sir Humphry Davy and Justus Liebig"
"But science increases at least as much as population"
"The latter increases in proportion to the size of the previous generation science advances in proportion to the knowledge bequeathed to it by the previous generation and thus under the most ordinary conditions also in a geometrical progression"
"And what is impossible to science"
"But it is absurd to talk of over population so long as there is enough waste land in the valley of the Mississippi for the whole population of Europe to be transplanted there"
"so long as no more than one third of the earth can be considered cultivated and so long as the production of this third itself can be raised sixfold and more by the application of improvements already known"
"Thus competition sets capital against capital labour against labour landed property against landed property and likewise each of these elements against the other two"
"In the struggle the stronger wins and in order to predict the outcome of the struggle we shall have to investigate the strength of the contestants"
"First of all labour is weaker than either landed property or capital for the worker must work to live whilst the landowner can live on his rent and the capitalist on his interest or if the need arises on his capital or on capitalised property in land"
"The result is that only the very barest necessities the mere means of subsistence fall to the lot of labour whilst the largest part of the products is shared between capital and landed property"
"Moreover the stronger worker drives the weaker out of the market just as larger capital drives out smaller capital and larger landed property drives out smaller landed property"
"Practice confirms this conclusion"
"The result is that already under ordinary conditions in accordance with the law of the stronger large capital and large landed property swallow small capital and small landed property i.e. centralisation of property"
"In crises of trade and agriculture this centralisation proceeds much more rapidly"
"In general large property increases much more rapidly than small property since a much smaller portion is deducted from its proceeds as property expenses"
"This law of the centralisation of private property is as immanent in private property as all the others"
"The middle classes must increasingly disappear until the world is divided into millionaires and paupers into large landowners and poor farm labourers"
"All the laws all the dividing of landed property all the possible splitting up of capital are of no avail this result must and will come unless it is anticipated by a total transformation of social conditions a fusion of opposed interests an abolition of private property"
"Free competition the keyword of our present day economists is an impossibility"
"Monopoly at least intended to protect the consumer against fraud even if it could not in fact do so"
"The abolition of monopoly however opens the door wide to fraud"
"You say that competition carries with it the remedy for fraud since no one will buy bad articles"
"But that means that everyone has to be an expert in every article which is impossible"
"Hence the necessity for monopoly which many articles in fact reveal"
"Pharmacies etc must have a monopoly"
"Whenever the circulating medium has ceased to be a state monopoly it has invariably produced a trade crisis and the English economists Dr. Wade among them do concede in this case the necessity for monopoly"
"But monopoly is no protection against counterfeit money"
"One can take one ’s stand on either side of the question the one is as difficult as the other"
"Monopoly produces free competition and the latter in turn produces monopoly"
"Therefore both must fall and these difficulties must be resolved through the transcendence of the principle which gives rise to them"
"Competition is the great mainspring which again and again jerks into activity our aging and withering social order or rather disorder but with each new exertion it also saps a part of this order ’s waning strength"
"Competition governs the numerical advance of mankind it likewise governs its moral advance"
"Anyone who has any knowledge of the statistics of crime must have been struck by the peculiar regularity with which crime advances year by year and with which certain causes produce certain crimes"
"This regularity proves that crime too is governed by competition that society creates a demand for crime which is met by a corresponding supply that the gap created by the arrest transportation or execution of a certain number is at once filled by others just as every gap in population is at once filled by new arrivals in other words that crime presses on the means of punishment just as the people press on the means of employment"
"How just it is to punish criminals under these circumstances quite apart from any other considerations I leave to the judgment of my readers"
"Here I am merely concerned in demonstrating the extension of competition into the moral sphere and in showing to what deep degradation private property has brought man"
"In the struggle of capital and land against labour the first two elements enjoy yet another special advantage over labour the assistance of science for in present conditions science too is directed against labour"
"Almost all mechanical inventions for instance have been occasioned by the lack of labour power in particular Hargreaves Crompton ’s and Arkwright ’s cotton spinning machines"
"There has never been an intense demand for labour which did not result in an invention that increased labour productivity considerably thus diverting demand away from human labour"
"The history of England from 1770 until now is a continuous demonstration of this"
"The last great invention in cotton spinning the self acting mule was occasioned solely by the demand for labour and rising wages"
"It doubled machine labour and thereby cut down hand labour by half it threw half the workers out of employment and thereby reduced the wages of the others by half it crushed a plot of the workers against the factory owners and destroyed the last vestige of strength with which labour had still held out in the unequal struggle against capital"
"Dr. Ure Philosophy of Manufactures Vol 2"
"The economist now says however that in its final result machinery is favourable to the workers since it makes production cheaper and thereby creates a new and larger market for its products and thus ultimately reemploys the workers put out of work"
"But is the economist forgetting then that the production of labour power is regulated by competition that labour power is always pressing on the means of employment and that therefore when these advantages are due to become operative a surplus of competitors for work is already waiting for them and will thus render these advantages illusory whilst the disadvantages the sudden withdrawal of the means of subsistence from one half of the workers and the fall in wages for the other half are not illusory"
"Is the economist forgetting that the progress of invention never stands still and that these disadvantages therefore perpetuate themselves"
"Is he forgetting that with the division of labour developed to such a high degree by our civilisation a worker can only live if he can be used at this particular machine for this particular detailed operation that the change over from one type of employment to another newer type is almost invariably an absolute impossibility for the adult worker"
"Besides I hope to have an early opportunity to expound in detail the despicable immorality of this system and to expose mercilessly the economist ’s hypocrisy which here appears in all its brazenness"
"Frederick Engels in Manchester Index for Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher | Index for 1844 | Marx Engels Archive"
"The term national wealth has only arisen as a result of the liberal economists passion for generalisation"
"As long as private property exists this term has no meaning"
"The national wealth of the English is very great and yet they are the poorest people under the sun"
"One must either discard this term completely or accept such premises as give it meaning"
"Similarly with the terms national economy and political or public economy"
"In the present circumstances that science ought to be called private economy for its public connections exist only for the sake of private property"
"The immediate consequence of private property is trade exchange of reciprocal requirements buying and selling"
"This trade like every activity must under the dominion of private property become a direct source of gain for the trader i.e. each must seek to sell as dear as possible and buy as cheap as possible"
"In every purchase and sale therefore two men with diametrically opposed interests confront each other"
"The confrontation is decidedly antagonistic for each knows the intentions of the other knows that they are opposed to his own"
"Thus the first maxim in trade is secretiveness the concealment of everything which might reduce the value of the article in question"
"The result is that in trade it is permitted to take the utmost advantage of the ignorance the trust of the opposing party and likewise to impute qualities to one ’s commodity which it does not possess"
"In a word trade is legalised fraud"
"Any merchant who wants to give truth its due can bear me witness that actual practice conforms with this theory"
"The Mercantile System still had a certain artless Catholic candour and did not in the least conceal the immoral nature of trade"
"We have seen how it openly paraded its mean avarice"
"The mutually hostile attitude of the nations in the eighteenth century loathsome envy and trade jealousy were the logical consequences of trade as such"
"Public opinion had not yet become humanised"
"But when the economic Luther Adam Smith criticised past economics things had changed considerably"
"The century had been humanised reason had asserted itself morality began to claim its eternal right"
"The extorted trade treaties the commercial wars the strict isolation of the nations offended too greatly against advanced consciousness"
"Wealth of Nations Bk 4 Ch"
"3 � 2 that after all it lay in the nature of things for trade taken overall to be advantageous to all parties concerned"
"Smith was right to eulogise trade as humane"
"There is nothing absolutely immoral in the world"
"Trade too has an aspect wherein it pays homage to morality and humanity"
"The law of the strong hand the open highway robbery of the Middle Ages became humanised when it passed over into trade and trade became humanised when its first stage characterised by the prohibition of the export of money passed over into the Mercantile System"
"Then the Mercantile System itself was humanised"
"Naturally it is in the interest of the trader to be on good terms with the one from whom he buys cheap as well as with the other to whom he sells dear"
"A nation therefore acts very imprudently if it fosters feelings of animosity in its suppliers and customers"
"The more friendly the more advantageous"
"Such is the humanity of trade"
"And this hypocritical way of misusing morality for immoral purposes is the pride of the free trade system"
"Have we not overthrown the barbarism of the monopolies exclaim the hypocrites"
"Have we not carried civilisation to distant parts of the world"
"Have we not brought about the fraternisation of the peoples and reduced the number of wars"
"Yes all this you have done but how"
"You have destroyed the small monopolies so that the one great basic monopoly property may function the more freely and unrestrictedly"
"You have civilised the ends of the earth to win new terrain for the deployment of your vile avarice"
"You have brought about the fraternisation of the peoples but the fraternity is the fraternity of thieves"
"You have reduced the number of wars to earn all the bigger profits in peace to intensify to the utmost the enmity between individuals the ignominious war of competition"
"When have you done anything out of pure humanity from consciousness of the futility of the opposition between the general and the individual interest"
"When have you been moral without being interested without harbouring at the back of your mind immoral egoistical motives"
"By dissolving nationalities the liberal economic system had done its best to universalise enmity to transform mankind into a horde of ravenous beasts for what else are competitors"
"who devour one another just because each has identical interests with all the others after this preparatory work there remained but one step to take before the goal was reached the dissolution of the family"
"To accomplish this economy ’s own beautiful invention the factory system came to its aid"
"The last vestige of common interests the community of goods in the possession of the family has been undermined by the factory system and at least here in England is already in the process of dissolution"
"It is a common practice for children as soon as they are capable of work i.e. as soon as they reach the age of nine to spend their wages themselves to look upon their parental home as a mere boarding house and hand over to their parents a fixed amount for food and lodging"
"How can it be otherwise"
"What else can result from the separation of interests such as forms the basis of the free trade system"
"Once a principle is set in motion it works by its own impetus through all its consequences whether the economists like it or not"
"But the economist does not know himself what cause he serves"
"He does not know that with all his egoistical reasoning he nevertheless forms but a link in the chain of mankind ’s universal progress"
"He does not know that by his dissolution of all sectional interests he merely paves the way for the great transformation to which the century is moving the reconciliation of mankind with nature and with itself"
"There is no dispute between the old and the modern economists over this category just as there is none over all the others since the monopolists in their obsessive mania for getting rich had no time left to concern themselves with categories"
"All controversies over such points stem from the modern economists"
"There was a protracted quarrel over the nature of real value between the English who defined the costs of production as the expression of real value and the Frenchman Say who claimed to measure this value by the utility of an object"
"The economists can not decide anything"
"The English McCulloch and Ricardo in particular thus assert that the abstract value of a thing is determined by the costs of production"
"Nota bene the abstract value not the exchangevalue the exchangeable value English term quoted by Engels"
"value in exchange that they say is something quite different"
"because no one in ordinary conditions and leaving aside the circumstance of competition would sell an object for less than it costs him to produce it"
"What have we to do with selling here where it is not a question of value in exchange"
"So we find trade again which we are specifically supposed to leave aside and what trade"
"A trade in which the cardinal factor the circumstance of competition is not to be taken into account"
"First an abstract value now also an abstract trade a trade without competition i.e. a man without a body a thought without a brain to produce thoughts"
"And does the economist never stop to think that as soon as competition is left out of account there is no guarantee at all that the producer will sell his commodity just at the cost of production"
"Furthermore Let us concede for a moment that everything is as the economist says"
"Certainly not says the economist Who will want to buy it"
"So we suddenly have not only Say ’s much decried utility but alongside it with buying the circumstance of competition"
"Not only what he painfully seeks to remove competition but also what he attacks utility crops up at every moment"
"Abstract value and its determination by the costs of production are after all only abstractions nonentities"
"But let us suppose once more for a moment that the economist is correct how then will he determine the costs of production without taking account of competition"
"When examining the costs of production we shall see that this category too is based on competition and here once more it becomes evident how little the economist is able to substantiate his claims"
"If we turn to Say we find the same abstraction"
"The utility of an object is something purely subjective something which can not be decided absolutely and certainly something which can not be decided at least as long as one still roams about in antitheses"
"According to this theory the necessities of life ought to possess more value than luxury articles"
"The only possible way to arrive at a more or less objective apparently general decision on the greater or lesser utility of an object is under the dominion of private property by competition and yet it is precisely that circumstance which is to be left aside"
"But if competition is admitted production costs come in as well for no one will sell for less than what he has himself invested in production"
"Thus here too the one side of the opposition passes over involuntarily into the other"
"Let us try to introduce clarity into this confusion"
"The value of an object includes both factors which the contending parties arbitrarily separate and as we have seen unsuccessfully"
"Value is the relation of production costs to utility"
"The first application of value is the decision as to whether a thing ought to be produced at all i.e. as to whether utility counterbalances production costs"
"The production costs of two objects being equal the deciding factor determining their comparative value will be utility"
"This basis is the only just basis of exchange"
"But if one proceeds from this basis who is to decide the utility of the object"
"The mere opinion of the parties concerned"
"Then in any event one will be cheated"
"Or are we to assume a determination grounded in the inherent utility of the object independent of the parties concerned and not apparent to them"
"If so the exchange can only be effected by coercion and each party considers itself cheated"
"The contradiction between the real inherent utility of the thing and the determination of that utility between the determination of utility and the freedom of those who exchange can not be superseded without superseding private property and once this is superseded there can no longer be any question of exchange as it exists at present"
"The practical application of the concept of value will then be increasingly confined to the decision about production and that is its proper sphere"
"But how do matters stand at present"
"We have seen that the concept of value is violently torn asunder and that each of the separate sides is declared to be the whole"
"Production costs distorted from the outset by competition are supposed to be value itself"
"So is mere subjective utility since no other kind of utility can exist at present"
"But what kind of utility what kind of production costs does it introduce"
"The difference between real value and exchange value is based on a fact namely that the value of a thing differs from the so called equivalent given for it in trade i.e. that this equivalent is not an equivalent"
"This so called equivalent is the price of the thing and if the economist were honest he would employ this term for value in exchange"
"But he has still to keep up some sort of pretence that price is somehow bound up with value lest the immorality of trade become too obvious"
"It is however quite correct and a fundamental law of private property that price is determined by the reciprocal action of production costs and competition"
"This purely empirical law was the first to be discovered by the economist and from this law he then abstracted his real value i.e. the price at the time when competition is in a state of equilibrium when demand and supply cover each other"
"Then of course what remains over are the costs of production and it is these which the economist proceeds to call real value whereas it is merely a definite aspect of price"
"Thus everything in economics stands on its head"
"Value the primary factor the source of price is made dependent on price its own product"
"As is well known this inversion is the essence of abstraction on which see Feuerbach"
"But it becomes immediately evident that capital and labour are identical since the economists themselves confess that capital is stored up labour"
"We are therefore left with only two sides the natural objective side land and the human subjective side labour which includes capital and besides capital a third factor which the economist does not think about I mean the mental element of invention of thought alongside the physical element of sheer labour"
"What has the economist to do with inventiveness"
"Have not all inventions fallen into his lap without any effort on his part"
"Has one of them cost him anything"
"Why then should he bother about them in the calculation of production costs"
"Science is no concern of his"
"What does it matter to him that he has received its gifts through Berthollet Davy Liebig Watt Cartwright etc gifts which have benefited him and his production immeasurably"
"He does not know how to calculate such things the advances of science go beyond his figures"
"But in a rational order which has gone beyond the division of interests as it is found with the economist the mental element certainly belongs among the elements of production and will find its place too in economics among the costs of production"
"And here it is certainly gratifying to know that the promotion of science also brings its material reward to know that a single achievement of science like James Watt ’s steam engine has brought in more for the world in the first fifty years of its existence than the world has spent on the promotion of science since the beginning of time"
"We have then two elements of production in operation nature and man with man again active physically and mentally and can now return to the economist and his production costs"
"What can not be monopolised has no value says the economist a proposition which we shall examine more closely later on"
"If we say has no price then the proposition is valid for the order which rests on private property"
"If land could be had as easily as air no one would pay rent"
"Since this is not the case but since rather the extent of a piece of land to be appropriated is limited in any particular case one pays rent for the appropriated i.e. the monopolised land or one pays down a purchase price for it"
"After this enlightenment about the origin of the value of land it is however very strange to have to hear from the economist that the rent of land is the difference between the yield from the land for which rent is paid and from the worst land worth cultivating at all"
"As is well known this is the definition of rent fully developed for the first time by Ricardo"
"This however is not the case and the definition is therefore inadequate"
"Moreover it does not cover the causation of rent and is therefore even for that reason untenable"
"In opposition to this definition Col T. P. Thompson the champion of the AntiCorn Law League revived Adam Smith ’s definition and substantiated it"
"According to him rent is the relation between the competition of those striving for the use of the land and the limited quantity of available land"
"Here at least is a return to the origin of rent but this explanation does not take into account the varying fertility of the soil just as the previous explanation leaves out competition"
"Once more therefore we have two one sided and hence only partial definitions of a single object"
"As in the case of the concept of value we shall again have to combine these two definitions so as to find the correct definition which follows from the development of the thing itself and thus embraces all practice"
"Rent is the relation between the productivity of the land the natural side which in turn consists of natural fertility and human cultivation"
"labour applied to effect improvement and the human side competition"
"The landowner has nothing with which to reproach the merchant"
"He practices robbery in monopolising the land"
"He practices robbery in exploiting for his own benefit the increase in population which increases competition and thus the value of his estate in turning into a source of personal advantage that which has not been his own doing that which is his by sheer accident"
"He practices robbery in leasing his land when he eventually seizes for himself the improvements effected by his tenant"
"This is the secret of the ever increasing wealth of the big landowners"
"The axioms which qualify as robbery the landowner ’s method of deriving an income namely that each has a right to the product of his labour or that no one shall reap where he has not sown are not advanced by us"
"These axioms are rather consequences of private property"
"One should either put into effect the consequences or abandon private property as a premise"
"Indeed the original act of appropriation itself is justified by the assertion of the still earlier existence of common property rights"
"Thus wherever we turn private property leads us into contradictions"
"It was and is to this very day an immorality surpassed only by the immorality of self alienation"
"And the original appropriation the monopolisation of the land by a few the exclusion of the rest from that which is the condition of their life yields nothing in immorality to the subsequent huckstering of the land"
"The value of the land divorced from it as rent then reverts to the land itself"
"This value to be measured by the productivity of equal areas of land subjected to equal applications of labour is indeed taken into account as part of the production costs when determining the value of products and like rent it is the relation of productivity to competition but to true competition such as will be developed when its time comes"
"We have seen that capital and labour are initially identical we see further from the explanations of the economist himself that in the process of production capital the result of labour is immediately transformed again into the substratum into the material of labour and that therefore the momentarily postulated separation of capital from labour is immediately superseded by the unity of both"
"And yet the economist separates capital from labour and yet clings to the division without giving any other recognition to their unity than by his definition of capital as stored up labour"
"The split between capital and labour resulting from private property is nothing but the inner dichotomy of labour corresponding to this divided condition and arising out of it"
"And after this separation is accomplished capital is divided once more into the original capital and profit the increment of capital which it receives in the process of production although in practice profit is immediately lumped together with capital and set into motion with it"
"Indeed even profit is in its turn split into interest and profit proper"
"The immorality of lending at interest of receiving without working merely for making a loan though already implied in private property is only too obvious and has long ago been recognised for what it is by unprejudiced popular consciousness which in such matters is usually right"
"All these subtle splits and divisions stem from the original separation of capital from labour and from the culmination of this separation the division of mankind into capitalists and workers a division which daily becomes ever more acute and which as we shall see is bound to deepen"
"This separation however like the separation already considered of land from capital and labour is in the final analysis an impossible separation"
"What share land capital and labour each have in any particular product can not be determined"
"The three magnitudes are incommensurable"
"The land produces the raw material but not without capital and labour"
"Capital presupposes land and labour"
"And labour presupposes at least land and usually also capital"
"The functions of these three elements are completely different and are not to be measured by a fourth common standard"
"Therefore when it comes to dividing the proceeds among the three elements under existing conditions there is no inherent standard it is an entirely alien and with regard to them fortuitous standard that decides"
"competition the cunning right of the stronger"
"Rent implies competition profit on capital is solely determined by competition and the position with regard to wages we shall see presently"
"If we abandon private property then all these unnatural divisions disappear"
"The difference between interest and profit disappears capital is nothing without labour without movement"
"The significance of profit is reduced to the weight which capital carries in the determination of the costs of production and profit thus remains inherent in capital in the same way as capital itself reverts to its original unity with labour"
"Labour the main factor in production the source of wealth free human activity comes off badly with the economist"
"Just as capital has already been separated from labour so labour is now in turn split for a second time the product of labour confronts labour as wages is separated from it and is in its turn as usual determined by competition there being as we have seen no firm standard determining labour ’s share in production"
"If we do away with private property this unnatural separation also disappears"
"We have seen that in the end everything comes down to competition so long as private property exists"
"It is the economist ’s principal category his most beloved daughter whom he ceaselessly caresses and look out for the Medusa ’s head which she will show you"
"The immediate consequence of private property was the split of production into two opposing sides the natural and the human sides the soil which without fertilisation by man is dead and sterile and human activity the first condition of which is that very soil"
"Furthermore we have seen how human activity in its turn was dissolved into labour and capital and how these two sides antagonistically confronted each other"
"Thus we already had the struggle of the three elements against one another instead of their mutual support now we have to add that private property brings in its wake"
"the fragmentation of each of these elements"
"One piece of land stands confronted by another one capital by another one labourer by another"
"In other words because private property isolates everyone in his own crude solitariness and because nevertheless everyone has the same interest as his neighbour one landowner stands antagonistically confronted by another one capitalist by another one worker by another"
"In this discord of identical interests resulting precisely from this identity is consummated the immorality of mankind ’s condition hitherto and this consummation is competition"
"The opposite of competition is monopoly"
"Monopoly was the war cry of the Mercantilists competition the battle cry of the liberal economists"
"It is easy to see that this antithesis is again a quite hollow antithesis"
"Every competitor can not but desire to have the monopoly be he worker capitalist or landowner"
"Each smaller group of competitors can not but desire to have the monopoly for itself against all others"
"Competition is based on self interest and self interest in turn breeds monopoly"
"In short competition passes over into monopoly"
"The contradiction of competition is exactly the same as that of private property"
"It is in the interest of each to possess everything but in the interest of the whole that each possess an equal amount"
"Thus the general and the individual interest are diametrically opposed to each other"
"The contradiction of competition is that each can not but desire the monopoly whilst the whole as such is bound to lose by monopoly and must therefore remove it"
"Moreover competition already presupposes monopoly namely the monopoly of property and here the hypocrisy of the liberals comes once more to light and so long as the monopoly of property exists for so long the possession of monopoly is equally justified for monopoly once it exists is also property"
"What a pitiful half measure therefore to attack the small monopolies and to leave untouched the basic monopoly"
"And if we add to this the economist ’s proposition mentioned above that nothing has value which can not be monopolised that nothing therefore which does not permit of such monopolisation can enter this arena of competition then our assertion that competition presupposes monopoly is completely justified"
"The law of competition is that demand and supply always strive to complement each other and therefore never do so"
"The two sides are torn apart again and transformed into flat opposition"
"Supply always follows close on demand without ever quite covering it"
"It is either too big or too small never corresponding to demand because in this unconscious condition of mankind no one knows how big supply or demand is"
"If demand is greater than supply the price rises and as a result supply is to a certain degree stimulated"
"As soon as it comes on to the market prices fall and if it becomes greater than demand then the fall in prices is so significant that demand is once again stimulated"
"So it goes on unendingly a permanently unhealthy state of affairs a constant alternation of over stimulation and flagging which precludes all advance a state of perpetual fluctuation without ever reaching its goal"
"This law with its constant adjustment in which whatever is lost here is gained there is regarded as something excellent by the economist"
"Yet it is obvious that this law is purely a law of nature and not a law of the mind"
"It is a law which produces revolution"
"The economist comes along with his lovely theory of demand and supply proves to you that one can never produce too much and practice replies with trade crises which reappear as regularly as the comets and of which we have now on the average one every five to seven years"
"For the last eighty years these trade crises have arrived just as regularly as the great plagues did in the past and they have brought in their train more misery and more immorality than the latter"
"Compare Wade History of the Middle and Working Classes London 1835 p. 211"
"What are we to think of a law which can only assert itself through periodic upheavals"
"It is certainly a natural law based on the unconsciousness of the participants"
"If the producers as such knew how much the consumers required if they were to organise production if they were to share it out amongst themselves then the fluctuations of competition and its tendency to crisis would be impossible"
"Carry on production consciously as human beings not as dispersed atoms without consciousness of your species and you have overcome all these artificial and untenable antitheses"
"But as long as you continue to produce in the present unconscious thoughtless manner at the mercy of chance for just so long trade crises will remain and each successive crisis is bound to become more universal and therefore worse than the preceding one is bound to impoverish a larger body of small capitalists and to augment in increasing proportion the numbers of the class who live by labour alone thus considerably enlarging the mass of labour to be employed the major problem of our economists and finally causing a social revolution such as has never been dreamt of in the philosophy of the economists"
"The perpetual fluctuation of prices such as is created by the condition of competition completely deprives trade of its last vestige of morality"
"It is no longer a question of value the same system which appears to attach such importance to value which confers on the abstraction of value in money form the honour of having an existence of its own this very system destroys by means of competition the inherent value of all things and daily and hourly changes the value relationship of all things to one another"
"Where is there any possibility remaining in this whirlpool of an exchange based on a moral foundation"
"In this continuous up and down everyone must seek to hit upon the most favourable moment for purchase and sale everyone must become a speculator that is to say must reap where he has not sown must enrich himself at the expense of others must calculate on the misfortune of others or let chance win for him"
"The speculator always counts on disasters particularly on bad harvests"
"He utilises everything for instance the New York fire December 16 1835 in its time and immorality ’s culminating point is the speculation on the Stock Exchange where history and with it mankind is demoted to a means of gratifying the avarice of the calculating or gambling speculator"
"And let not the honest respectable merchant rise above the gambling on the Stock Exchange with a Pharisaic"
"I thank thee O Lord etc"
"He is as bad as the speculators in stocks and shares"
"He has to competition compels him to"
"The truth of the relation of competition is the relation of consumption to productivity"
"In a world worthy of mankind there will be no other competition than this"
"The community will have to calculate what it can produce with the means at its disposal and in accordance with the relationship of this productive power to the mass of consumers it will determine how far it has to raise or lower production how far it has to give way to or curtail luxury"
"But so that they may be able to pass a correct judgment on this relationship and on the increase in productive power to be expected from a rational state of affairs within the community I invite my readers to consult the writings of the English Socialists and partly also those of Fourier"
"Subjective competition the contest of capital against capital of labour against labour etc will under these conditions be reduced to the spirit of emulation grounded in human nature a concept tolerably set forth so far only by Fourier which after the transcendence of opposing interests will be confined to its proper and rational sphere"
"The struggle of capital against capital of labour against labour of land against land drives production to a fever pitch at which production turns all natural and rational relations upside down"
"No capital can stand the competition of another if it is not brought to the highest pitch of activity"
"No piece of land can be profitably cultivated if it does not continuously increase its productivity"
"No worker can hold his own against his competitors if he does not devote all his energy to labour"
"No one at all who enters into the struggle of competition can weather it without the utmost exertion of his energy without renouncing every truly human purpose"
"The consequence of this over exertion on the one side is inevitably slackening on the other"
"When the fluctuation of competition is small when demand and supply consumption and production are almost equal a stage must be reached in the development of production where there is so much superfluous productive power that the great mass of the nation has nothing to live on that the people starve from sheer abundance"
"For some considerable time England has found herself in this crazy position in this living absurdity"
"When production is subject to greater fluctuations as it is bound to be in consequence of such a situation then the alternation of boom and crisis overproduction and slump sets in"
"The economist has never been able to find an explanation for this mad situation"
"In order to explain it he invented the population theory which is just as senseless indeed even more senseless than the contradiction of coexisting wealth and poverty"
"The economist could not afford to see the truth he could not afford to admit that this contradiction is a simple consequence of competition for in that case his entire system would have fallen to bits"
"For us the matter is easy to explain"
"The productive power at mankind ’s disposal is immeasurable"
"The productivity of the soil can be increased ad infinitum by the application of capital labour and science"
"According to the most able economists and statisticians cf"
"Alison ’s Principles of Population Vol"
"I Chs 1 and 2 over populated Great Britain can be brought within ten years to produce a corn yield sufficient for a population six times its present size"
"Capital increases daily labour power grows with population and day by day science increasingly makes the forces of nature subject to man"
"This immeasurable productive capacity handled consciously and in the interest of all would soon reduce to a minimum the labour falling to the share of mankind"
"Left to competition it does the same but within a context of antitheses"
"One part of the land is cultivated in the best possible manner whilst another part in Great Britain and Ireland thirty million acres of good land lies barren"
"One part of capital circulates with colossal speed another lies dead in the chest"
"One part of the workers works fourteen or sixteen hours a day whilst another part stands idle and inactive and starves"
"Or the partition leaves this realm of simultaneity today trade is good demand is very considerable everyone works capital is turned over with miraculous speed farming flourishes the workers work themselves sick"
"Tomorrow stagnation sets in"
"The cultivation of the land is not worth the effort entire stretches of land remain untilled the flow of capital suddenly freezes the workers have no employment and the whole country labours under surplus wealth and surplus population"
"The economist can not afford to accept this exposition of the subject as correct otherwise as has been said he would have to give up his whole system of competition"
"He would have to recognise the hollowness of his antithesis of production and consumption of surplus population and surplus wealth"
"To bring fact and theory into conformity with each other since this fact simply could not be denied the population theory was invented"
"Malthus the originator of this doctrine maintains that population is always pressing on the means of subsistence that as soon as production increases population increases in the same proportion and that the inherent tendency of the population to multiply in excess of the available means of subsistence is the root of all misery and all vice"
"For when there are too many people they have to be disposed of in one way or another either they must be killed by violence or they must starve"
"But when this has happened there is once more a gap which other multipliers of the population immediately start to fill up once more and so the old misery begins all over again"
"What is more this is the case in all circumstances not only in civilised but also in primitive conditions"
"In New Holland The old name for Australia"
"with a population density of one per square mile the savages suffer just as much from over population as England"
"The implications of this line of thought are that since it is precisely the poor who are the surplus nothing should be done for them except to make their dying of starvation as easy as possible and to convince them that it can not be helped and that there is no other salvation for their whole class than keeping propagation down to the absolute minimum"
"Or if this proves impossible then it is after all better to establish a state institution for the painless killing of the children of the poor such as Marcus"
"has suggested whereby each working class family would be allowed to have two and a half children any excess being painlessly killed"
"Charity is to be considered a crime since it supports the augmentation of the surplus population"
"Indeed it will be very advantageous to declare poverty a crime and to turn poor houses into prisons as has already happened in England as a result of the new liberal Poor Law"
"Admittedly it is true that this theory ill conforms with the Bible ’s doctrine of the perfection of God and of His creation but it is a poor refutation to enlist the Bible against facts"
"Am I to go on any longer elaborating this vile infamous theory this hideous blasphemy against nature and mankind"
"Am I to pursue its consequences any further"
"Here at last we have the immorality of the economist brought to its highest pitch"
"What are all the wars and horrors of the monopoly system compared with this theory"
"And it is just this theory which is the keystone of the liberal system of free trade whose fall entails the downfall of the entire edifice"
"For if here competition is proved to be the cause of misery poverty and crime who then will still dare to speak up for it"
"In his above mentioned work Alison has shaken the Malthusian theory by bringing in the productive power of the land and by opposing to the Malthusian principle the fact that each adult can produce more than he himself needs a fact without which mankind could not multiply indeed could not even exist if it were not so how could those still growing up live"
"But Alison does not go to the root of the matter and therefore in the end reaches the same conclusion as Malthus"
"True enough he proves that Malthus principle is incorrect but can not gainsay the facts which have impelled Malthus to his principle"
"If Malthus had not considered the matter so one sidedly he could not have failed to see that surplus population or labour power is invariably tied up with surplus wealth surplus capital and surplus landed property"
"The population is only too large where the productive power as a whole is too large"
"The condition of every over populated country particularly England since the time when Malthus wrote makes this abundantly clear"
"These were the facts which Malthus ought to have considered in their totality and whose consideration was bound to have led to the correct conclusion"
"Instead he selected one fact gave no consideration to the others and therefore arrived at his crazy conclusion"
"The second error he committed was to confuse means of subsistence with means of employment"
"That population is always pressing on the means of employment that the number of people produced depends on the number of people who can be employed in short that the production of labour power has been regulated so far by the law of competition and is therefore also exposed to periodic crises and fluctuations this is a fact whose establishment constitutes Malthus merit"
"But the means of employment are not the means of subsistence"
"Only in their end result are the means of employment increased by the increase in machin epower and capital"
"The means of subsistence increase as soon as productive power increases even slightly"
"Here a new contradiction in economics comes to light"
"The economist ’s demand is not the real demand his consumption is an artificial consumption"
"For the economist only that person really demands only that person is a real consumer who has an equivalent to offer for what he receives"
"But if it is a fact that every adult produces more than he himself can consume that children are like trees which give superabundant returns on the outlays invested in them and these certainly are facts are they not then it must be assumed that each worker ought to be able to produce far more than he needs and that the community therefore ought to be very glad to provide him with everything he needs one must consider a large family to be a very welcome gift for the community"
"But the economist with his crude outlook knows no other equivalent than that which is paid to him in tangible ready cash"
"He is so firmly set in his antitheses that the most striking facts are of as little concern to him as the most scientific principles"
"We destroy the contradiction simply by transcending it"
"With the fusion of the interests now opposed to each other there disappears the contradiction between excess population here and excess wealth there there disappears the miraculous fact more miraculous than all the miracles of all the religions put together that a nation has to starve from sheer wealth and plenty and there disappears the crazy assertion that the earth lacks the power to feed men"
"The Malthusian theory is but the economic expression of the religious dogma of the contradiction of spirit and nature and the resulting corruption of both"
"As regards religion and together with religion this contradiction was resolved long ago and I hope that in the sphere of economics I have likewise demonstrated the utter emptiness of this contradiction"
"Moreover I shall not accept as competent any defence of the Malthusian theory which does not explain to me on the basis of its own principles how a people can starve from sheer plenty and bring this into harmony with reason and fact"
"At the same time the Malthusian theory has certainly been a necessary point of transition which has taken us an immense step further"
"We derive from it the most powerful economic arguments for a social transformation"
"Through this theory we have come to know the deepest degradation of mankind their dependence on the conditions of competition"
"All this we have seen and all this drives us to the abolition of this degradation of mankind through the abolition of private property competition and the opposing interests"
"Yet so as to deprive the universal fear of overpopulation of any possible basis let us once more return to the relationship of productive power to population"
"Malthus establishes a formula on which he bases his entire system population is said to increase in a geometrical progression 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 etc"
"the productive power of the land in an arithmetical progression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6"
"The difference is obvious is terrifying but is it correct"
"Where has it been proved that the productivity of the land increases in an arithmetical progression"
"The labour power to be employed on this land surface increases with population"
"Even if we assume that the increase in yield due to increase in labour does not always rise in proportion to the labour there still remains a third element which admittedly never means anything to the economist science whose progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population"
"What progress does the agriculture of this century owe to chemistry alone indeed to two men alone Sir Humphry Davy and Justus Liebig"
"But science increases at least as much as population"
"But it is absurd to talk of over population so long as there is enough waste land in the valley of the Mississippi for the whole population of Europe to be transplanted there"
"Thus competition sets capital against capital labour against labour landed property against landed property and likewise each of these elements against the other two"
"In the struggle the stronger wins and in order to predict the outcome of the struggle we shall have to investigate the strength of the contestants"
"First of all labour is weaker than either landed property or capital for the worker must work to live whilst the landowner can live on his rent and the capitalist on his interest or if the need arises on his capital or on capitalised property in land"
"The result is that only the very barest necessities the mere means of subsistence fall to the lot of labour whilst the largest part of the products is shared between capital and landed property"
"Moreover the stronger worker drives the weaker out of the market just as larger capital drives out smaller capital and larger landed property drives out smaller landed property"
"Practice confirms this conclusion"
"The advantages which the larger manufacturer and merchant enjoy over the smaller and the big landowner over the owner of a single acre are well known"
"The result is that already under ordinary conditions in accordance with the law of the stronger large capital and large landed property swallow small capital and small landed property i.e. centralisation of property"
"In crises of trade and agriculture this centralisation proceeds much more rapidly"
"In general large property increases much more rapidly than small property since a much smaller portion is deducted from its proceeds as property expenses"
"This law of the centralisation of private property is as immanent in private property as all the others"
"The middle classes must increasingly disappear until the world is divided into millionaires and paupers into large landowners and poor farm labourers"
"All the laws all the dividing of landed property all the possible splitting up of capital are of no avail this result must and will come unless it is anticipated by a total transformation of social conditions a fusion of opposed interests an abolition of private property"
"Free competition the keyword of our present day economists is an impossibility"
"Monopoly at least intended to protect the consumer against fraud even if it could not in fact do so"
"The abolition of monopoly however opens the door wide to fraud"
"But that means that everyone has to be an expert in every article which is impossible"
"Hence the necessity for monopoly which many articles in fact reveal"
"Pharmacies etc must have a monopoly"
"And the most important article money requires a monopoly most of all"
"Whenever the circulating medium has ceased to be a state monopoly it has invariably produced a trade crisis and the English economists Dr. Wade among them do concede in this case the necessity for monopoly"
"But monopoly is no protection against counterfeit money"
"One can take one ’s stand on either side of the question the one is as difficult as the other"
"Monopoly produces free competition and the latter in turn produces monopoly"
"Therefore both must fall and these difficulties must be resolved through the transcendence of the principle which gives rise to them"
"Competition has penetrated all the relationships of our life and completed the reciprocal bondage in which men now hold themselves"
"Competition is the great mainspring which again and again jerks into activity our aging and withering social order or rather disorder but with each new exertion it also saps a part of this order ’s waning strength"
"Competition governs the numerical advance of mankind it likewise governs its moral advance"
"Anyone who has any knowledge of the statistics of crime must have been struck by the peculiar regularity with which crime advances year by year and with which certain causes produce certain crimes"
"The extension of the factory system is followed everywhere by an increase in crime"
"The number of arrests of criminal cases indeed the number of murders burglaries petty thefts etc for a large town or for a district can be predicted year by year with unfailing precision as has been done often enough in England"
"This regularity proves that crime too is governed by competition that society creates a demand for crime which is met by a corresponding supply that the gap created by the arrest transportation or execution of a certain number is at once filled by others just as every gap in population is at once filled by new arrivals in other words that crime presses on the means of punishment just as the people press on the means of employment"
"How just it is to punish criminals under these circumstances quite apart from any other considerations I leave to the judgment of my readers"
"Here I am merely concerned in demonstrating the extension of competition into the moral sphere and in showing to what deep degradation private property has brought man"
"In the struggle of capital and land against labour the first two elements enjoy yet another special advantage over labour the assistance of science for in present conditions science too is directed against labour"
"Almost all mechanical inventions for instance have been occasioned by the lack of labour power in particular Hargreaves Crompton ’s and Arkwright ’s cotton spinning machines"
"There has never been an intense demand for labour which did not result in an invention that increased labour productivity considerably thus diverting demand away from human labour"
"The last great invention in cotton spinning the self acting mule was occasioned solely by the demand for labour and rising wages"
"It doubled machine labour and thereby cut down hand labour by half it threw half the workers out of employment and thereby reduced the wages of the others by half it crushed a plot of the workers against the factory owners and destroyed the last vestige of strength with which labour had still held out in the unequal struggle against capital"
"Dr. Ure Philosophy of Manufactures Vol 2"
"The economist now says however that in its final result machinery is favourable to the workers since it makes production cheaper and thereby creates a new and larger market for its products and thus ultimately reemploys the workers put out of work"
"But is the economist forgetting then that the production of labour power is regulated by competition that labour power is always pressing on the means of employment and that therefore when these advantages are due to become operative a surplus of competitors for work is already waiting for them and will thus render these advantages illusory whilst the disadvantages the sudden withdrawal of the means of subsistence from one half of the workers and the fall in wages for the other half are not illusory"
"Is the economist forgetting that the progress of invention never stands still and that these disadvantages therefore perpetuate themselves"
"Is he forgetting that with the division of labour developed to such a high degree by our civilisation a worker can only live if he can be used at this particular machine for this particular detailed operation that the change over from one type of employment to another newer type is almost invariably an absolute impossibility for the adult worker"
"In turning my attention to the effects of machinery I am brought to another subject less directly relevant the factory system and I have neither the inclination nor the time to treat this here"
"Besides I hope to have an early opportunity to expound in detail the despicable immorality of this system and to expose mercilessly the economist ’s hypocrisy which here appears in all its brazenness"
"Frederick Engels in Manchester Index for Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher | Index for 1844 | Marx Engels Archive"
"The English McCulloch and Ricardo in particular thus assert that the abstract value of a thing is determined by the costs of production"
"Nota bene the abstract value not the exchangevalue the exchangeable value English term quoted by Engels"
"value in exchange that they say is something quite different"
"Why are the costs of production the measure of value"
"Because listen to this"
"because no one in ordinary conditions and leaving aside the circumstance of competition would sell an object for less than it costs him to produce it"
"What have we to do with selling here where it is not a question of value in exchange"
"So we find trade again which we are specifically supposed to leave aside and what trade"
"A trade in which the cardinal factor the circumstance of competition is not to be taken into account"
"First an abstract value now also an abstract trade a trade without competition i.e. a man without a body a thought without a brain to produce thoughts"
"And does the economist never stop to think that as soon as competition is left out of account there is no guarantee at all that the producer will sell his commodity just at the cost of production"
"Supposing someone were to make with tremendous exertion and at enormous cost something utterly useless something which no one desires is that also worth its production costs"
"Certainly not says the economist Who will want to buy it"
"So we suddenly have not only Say ’s much decried utility but alongside it with buying the circumstance of competition"
"It ca n’t be done the economist can not for one moment hold on to his abstraction"
"Not only what he painfully seeks to remove competition but also what he attacks utility crops up at every moment"
"Abstract value and its determination by the costs of production are after all only abstractions nonentities"
"But let us suppose once more for a moment that the economist is correct how then will he determine the costs of production without taking account of competition"
"When examining the costs of production we shall see that this category too is based on competition and here once more it becomes evident how little the economist is able to substantiate his claims"
"If we turn to Say we find the same abstraction"
"According to this theory the necessities of life ought to possess more value than luxury articles"
"The only possible way to arrive at a more or less objective apparently general decision on the greater or lesser utility of an object is under the dominion of private property by competition and yet it is precisely that circumstance which is to be left aside"
"Let us try to introduce clarity into this confusion"
"The value of an object includes both factors which the contending parties arbitrarily separate and as we have seen unsuccessfully"
"Value is the relation of production costs to utility"
"The first application of value is the decision as to whether a thing ought to be produced at all i.e. as to whether utility counterbalances production costs"
"Only then can one talk of the application of value to exchange"
"The production costs of two objects being equal the deciding factor determining their comparative value will be utility"
"This basis is the only just basis of exchange"
"The mere opinion of the parties concerned"
"Then in any event one will be cheated"
"Or are we to assume a determination grounded in the inherent utility of the object independent of the parties concerned and not apparent to them"
"If so the exchange can only be effected by coercion and each party considers itself cheated"
"The contradiction between the real inherent utility of the thing and the determination of that utility between the determination of utility and the freedom of those who exchange can not be superseded without superseding private property and once this is superseded there can no longer be any question of exchange as it exists at present"
"The practical application of the concept of value will then be increasingly confined to the decision about production and that is its proper sphere"
"But how do matters stand at present"
"We have seen that the concept of value is violently torn asunder and that each of the separate sides is declared to be the whole"
"Production costs distorted from the outset by competition are supposed to be value itself"
"So is mere subjective utility since no other kind of utility can exist at present"
"To help these lame definitions on to their feet it is in both cases necessary to have recourse to competition and the best of it is that with the English competition represents utility in contrast to the costs of production whilst inversely with Say it introduces the costs of production in contrast to utility"
"But what kind of utility what kind of production costs does it introduce"
"Its utility depends on chance on fashion on the whim of the rich its production costs fluctuate with the fortuitous relationship of demand and supply"
"The difference between real value and exchange value is based on a fact namely that the value of a thing differs from the so called equivalent given for it in trade i.e. that this equivalent is not an equivalent"
"This so called equivalent is the price of the thing and if the economist were honest he would employ this term for value in exchange"
"But he has still to keep up some sort of pretence that price is somehow bound up with value lest the immorality of trade become too obvious"
"It is however quite correct and a fundamental law of private property that price is determined by the reciprocal action of production costs and competition"
"This purely empirical law was the first to be discovered by the economist and from this law he then abstracted his real value i.e. the price at the time when competition is in a state of equilibrium when demand and supply cover each other"
"Then of course what remains over are the costs of production and it is these which the economist proceeds to call real value whereas it is merely a definite aspect of price"
"Thus everything in economics stands on its head"
"Value the primary factor the source of price is made dependent on price its own product"
"As is well known this inversion is the essence of abstraction on which see Feuerbach"
"According to the economists the production costs of a commodity consist of three elements the rent for the piece of land required to produce the raw material the capital with its profit and the wages for the labour required for production and manufacture"
"But it becomes immediately evident that capital and labour are identical since the economists themselves confess that capital is stored up labour"
"We are therefore left with only two sides the natural objective side land and the human subjective side labour which includes capital and besides capital a third factor which the economist does not think about I mean the mental element of invention of thought alongside the physical element of sheer labour"
"What has the economist to do with inventiveness"
"Have not all inventions fallen into his lap without any effort on his part"
"Has one of them cost him anything"
"Why then should he bother about them in the calculation of production costs"
"Land capital and labour are for him the conditions of wealth and he requires nothing else"
"Science is no concern of his"
"What does it matter to him that he has received its gifts through Berthollet Davy Liebig Watt Cartwright etc gifts which have benefited him and his production immeasurably"
"He does not know how to calculate such things the advances of science go beyond his figures"
"But in a rational order which has gone beyond the division of interests as it is found with the economist the mental element certainly belongs among the elements of production and will find its place too in economics among the costs of production"
"And here it is certainly gratifying to know that the promotion of science also brings its material reward to know that a single achievement of science like James Watt ’s steam engine has brought in more for the world in the first fifty years of its existence than the world has spent on the promotion of science since the beginning of time"
"We have then two elements of production in operation nature and man with man again active physically and mentally and can now return to the economist and his production costs"
"What can not be monopolised has no value says the economist a proposition which we shall examine more closely later on"
"If land could be had as easily as air no one would pay rent"
"After this enlightenment about the origin of the value of land it is however very strange to have to hear from the economist that the rent of land is the difference between the yield from the land for which rent is paid and from the worst land worth cultivating at all"
"As is well known this is the definition of rent fully developed for the first time by Ricardo"
"This definition is indeed correct in practice if one presupposes that a fall in demand reacts instantaneously on rent and at once puts a corresponding amount of the worst cultivated land out of cultivation"
"This however is not the case and the definition is therefore inadequate"
"Moreover it does not cover the causation of rent and is therefore even for that reason untenable"
"In opposition to this definition Col T. P. Thompson the champion of the AntiCorn Law League revived Adam Smith ’s definition and substantiated it"
"According to him rent is the relation between the competition of those striving for the use of the land and the limited quantity of available land"
"Here at least is a return to the origin of rent but this explanation does not take into account the varying fertility of the soil just as the previous explanation leaves out competition"
"Once more therefore we have two one sided and hence only partial definitions of a single object"
"Rent is the relation between the productivity of the land the natural side which in turn consists of natural fertility and human cultivation"
"labour applied to effect improvement and the human side competition"
"The economists may shake their heads over this definition they will discover to their horror that it embraces everything relevant to this matter"
"The landowner has nothing with which to reproach the merchant"
"He practices robbery in monopolising the land"
"He practices robbery in exploiting for his own benefit the increase in population which increases competition and thus the value of his estate in turning into a source of personal advantage that which has not been his own doing that which is his by sheer accident"
"He practices robbery in leasing his land when he eventually seizes for himself the improvements effected by his tenant"
"This is the secret of the ever increasing wealth of the big landowners"
"The axioms which qualify as robbery the landowner ’s method of deriving an income namely that each has a right to the product of his labour or that no one shall reap where he has not sown are not advanced by us"
"The first excludes the duty of feeding children the second deprives each generation of the right to live since each generation starts with what it inherits from the preceding generation"
"These axioms are rather consequences of private property"
"One should either put into effect the consequences or abandon private property as a premise"
"Indeed the original act of appropriation itself is justified by the assertion of the still earlier existence of common property rights"
"To make land an object of huckstering the land which is our one and all the first condition of our existence was the last step towards making oneself an object of huckstering"
"It was and is to this very day an immorality surpassed only by the immorality of self alienation"
"And the original appropriation the monopolisation of the land by a few the exclusion of the rest from that which is the condition of their life yields nothing in immorality to the subsequent huckstering of the land"
"If here again we abandon private property rent is reduced to its truth to the rational notion which essentially lies at its root"
"The value of the land divorced from it as rent then reverts to the land itself"
"This value to be measured by the productivity of equal areas of land subjected to equal applications of labour is indeed taken into account as part of the production costs when determining the value of products and like rent it is the relation of productivity to competition but to true competition such as will be developed when its time comes"
"We have seen that capital and labour are initially identical we see further from the explanations of the economist himself that in the process of production capital the result of labour is immediately transformed again into the substratum into the material of labour and that therefore the momentarily postulated separation of capital from labour is immediately superseded by the unity of both"
"And yet the economist separates capital from labour and yet clings to the division without giving any other recognition to their unity than by his definition of capital as stored up labour"
"The split between capital and labour resulting from private property is nothing but the inner dichotomy of labour corresponding to this divided condition and arising out of it"
"And after this separation is accomplished capital is divided once more into the original capital and profit the increment of capital which it receives in the process of production although in practice profit is immediately lumped together with capital and set into motion with it"
"Indeed even profit is in its turn split into interest and profit proper"
"The immorality of lending at interest of receiving without working merely for making a loan though already implied in private property is only too obvious and has long ago been recognised for what it is by unprejudiced popular consciousness which in such matters is usually right"
"All these subtle splits and divisions stem from the original separation of capital from labour and from the culmination of this separation the division of mankind into capitalists and workers a division which daily becomes ever more acute and which as we shall see is bound to deepen"
"This separation however like the separation already considered of land from capital and labour is in the final analysis an impossible separation"
"What share land capital and labour each have in any particular product can not be determined"
"The three magnitudes are incommensurable"
"The land produces the raw material but not without capital and labour"
"Capital presupposes land and labour"
"The functions of these three elements are completely different and are not to be measured by a fourth common standard"
"Therefore when it comes to dividing the proceeds among the three elements under existing conditions there is no inherent standard it is an entirely alien and with regard to them fortuitous standard that decides"
"competition the cunning right of the stronger"
"Rent implies competition profit on capital is solely determined by competition and the position with regard to wages we shall see presently"
"If we abandon private property then all these unnatural divisions disappear"
"The difference between interest and profit disappears capital is nothing without labour without movement"
"The significance of profit is reduced to the weight which capital carries in the determination of the costs of production and profit thus remains inherent in capital in the same way as capital itself reverts to its original unity with labour"
"Labour the main factor in production the source of wealth free human activity comes off badly with the economist"
"Just as capital has already been separated from labour so labour is now in turn split for a second time the product of labour confronts labour as wages is separated from it and is in its turn as usual determined by competition there being as we have seen no firm standard determining labour ’s share in production"
"If we do away with private property this unnatural separation also disappears"
"Labour becomes its own reward and the true significance of the wages of labour hitherto alienated comes to light namely the significance of labour for the determination of the production costs of a thing"
"We have seen that in the end everything comes down to competition so long as private property exists"
"It is the economist ’s principal category his most beloved daughter whom he ceaselessly caresses and look out for the Medusa ’s head which she will show you"
"The immediate consequence of private property was the split of production into two opposing sides the natural and the human sides the soil which without fertilisation by man is dead and sterile and human activity the first condition of which is that very soil"
"Thus we already had the struggle of the three elements against one another instead of their mutual support now we have to add that private property brings in its wake"
"the fragmentation of each of these elements"
"One piece of land stands confronted by another one capital by another one labourer by another"
"In other words because private property isolates everyone in his own crude solitariness and because nevertheless everyone has the same interest as his neighbour one landowner stands antagonistically confronted by another one capitalist by another one worker by another"
"In this discord of identical interests resulting precisely from this identity is consummated the immorality of mankind ’s condition hitherto and this consummation is competition"
"Monopoly was the war cry of the Mercantilists competition the battle cry of the liberal economists"
"It is easy to see that this antithesis is again a quite hollow antithesis"
"Every competitor can not but desire to have the monopoly be he worker capitalist or landowner"
"Each smaller group of competitors can not but desire to have the monopoly for itself against all others"
"Competition is based on self interest and self interest in turn breeds monopoly"
"In short competition passes over into monopoly"
"On the other hand monopoly can not stem the tide of competition indeed it itself breeds competition just as a prohibition of imports for instance or high tariffs positively breed the competition of smuggling"
"The contradiction of competition is exactly the same as that of private property"
"It is in the interest of each to possess everything but in the interest of the whole that each possess an equal amount"
"The contradiction of competition is that each can not but desire the monopoly whilst the whole as such is bound to lose by monopoly and must therefore remove it"
"Moreover competition already presupposes monopoly namely the monopoly of property and here the hypocrisy of the liberals comes once more to light and so long as the monopoly of property exists for so long the possession of monopoly is equally justified for monopoly once it exists is also property"
"What a pitiful half measure therefore to attack the small monopolies and to leave untouched the basic monopoly"
"And if we add to this the economist ’s proposition mentioned above that nothing has value which can not be monopolised that nothing therefore which does not permit of such monopolisation can enter this arena of competition then our assertion that competition presupposes monopoly is completely justified"
"The law of competition is that demand and supply always strive to complement each other and therefore never do so"
"The two sides are torn apart again and transformed into flat opposition"
"Supply always follows close on demand without ever quite covering it"
"It is either too big or too small never corresponding to demand because in this unconscious condition of mankind no one knows how big supply or demand is"
"If demand is greater than supply the price rises and as a result supply is to a certain degree stimulated"
"As soon as it comes on to the market prices fall and if it becomes greater than demand then the fall in prices is so significant that demand is once again stimulated"
"So it goes on unendingly a permanently unhealthy state of affairs a constant alternation of over stimulation and flagging which precludes all advance a state of perpetual fluctuation without ever reaching its goal"
"This law with its constant adjustment in which whatever is lost here is gained there is regarded as something excellent by the economist"
"It is his chief glory he can not see enough of it and considers it in all its possible and impossible applications"
"Yet it is obvious that this law is purely a law of nature and not a law of the mind"
"The economist comes along with his lovely theory of demand and supply proves to you that one can never produce too much and practice replies with trade crises which reappear as regularly as the comets and of which we have now on the average one every five to seven years"
"For the last eighty years these trade crises have arrived just as regularly as the great plagues did in the past and they have brought in their train more misery and more immorality than the latter"
"Of course these commercial upheavals confirm the law confirm it exhaustively but in a manner different from that which the economist would have us believe to be the case"
"What are we to think of a law which can only assert itself through periodic upheavals"
"It is certainly a natural law based on the unconsciousness of the participants"
"If the producers as such knew how much the consumers required if they were to organise production if they were to share it out amongst themselves then the fluctuations of competition and its tendency to crisis would be impossible"
"Carry on production consciously as human beings not as dispersed atoms without consciousness of your species and you have overcome all these artificial and untenable antitheses"
"But as long as you continue to produce in the present unconscious thoughtless manner at the mercy of chance for just so long trade crises will remain and each successive crisis is bound to become more universal and therefore worse than the preceding one is bound to impoverish a larger body of small capitalists and to augment in increasing proportion the numbers of the class who live by labour alone thus considerably enlarging the mass of labour to be employed the major problem of our economists and finally causing a social revolution such as has never been dreamt of in the philosophy of the economists"
"The perpetual fluctuation of prices such as is created by the condition of competition completely deprives trade of its last vestige of morality"
"It is no longer a question of value the same system which appears to attach such importance to value which confers on the abstraction of value in money form the honour of having an existence of its own this very system destroys by means of competition the inherent value of all things and daily and hourly changes the value relationship of all things to one another"
"Where is there any possibility remaining in this whirlpool of an exchange based on a moral foundation"
"In this continuous up and down everyone must seek to hit upon the most favourable moment for purchase and sale everyone must become a speculator that is to say must reap where he has not sown must enrich himself at the expense of others must calculate on the misfortune of others or let chance win for him"
"The speculator always counts on disasters particularly on bad harvests"
"He utilises everything for instance the New York fire December 16 1835 in its time and immorality ’s culminating point is the speculation on the Stock Exchange where history and with it mankind is demoted to a means of gratifying the avarice of the calculating or gambling speculator"
"And let not the honest respectable merchant rise above the gambling on the Stock Exchange with a Pharisaic"
"I thank thee O Lord etc"
"He is as bad as the speculators in stocks and shares"
"He has to competition compels him to"
"And his trading activity therefore implies the same immorality as theirs"
"The truth of the relation of competition is the relation of consumption to productivity"
"In a world worthy of mankind there will be no other competition than this"
"The community will have to calculate what it can produce with the means at its disposal and in accordance with the relationship of this productive power to the mass of consumers it will determine how far it has to raise or lower production how far it has to give way to or curtail luxury"
"But so that they may be able to pass a correct judgment on this relationship and on the increase in productive power to be expected from a rational state of affairs within the community I invite my readers to consult the writings of the English Socialists and partly also those of Fourier"
"Subjective competition the contest of capital against capital of labour against labour etc will under these conditions be reduced to the spirit of emulation grounded in human nature a concept tolerably set forth so far only by Fourier which after the transcendence of opposing interests will be confined to its proper and rational sphere"
"The struggle of capital against capital of labour against labour of land against land drives production to a fever pitch at which production turns all natural and rational relations upside down"
"No piece of land can be profitably cultivated if it does not continuously increase its productivity"
"No worker can hold his own against his competitors if he does not devote all his energy to labour"
"The consequence of this over exertion on the one side is inevitably slackening on the other"
"When the fluctuation of competition is small when demand and supply consumption and production are almost equal a stage must be reached in the development of production where there is so much superfluous productive power that the great mass of the nation has nothing to live on that the people starve from sheer abundance"
"For some considerable time England has found herself in this crazy position in this living absurdity"
"When production is subject to greater fluctuations as it is bound to be in consequence of such a situation then the alternation of boom and crisis overproduction and slump sets in"
"The economist has never been able to find an explanation for this mad situation"
"In order to explain it he invented the population theory which is just as senseless indeed even more senseless than the contradiction of coexisting wealth and poverty"
"The economist could not afford to see the truth he could not afford to admit that this contradiction is a simple consequence of competition for in that case his entire system would have fallen to bits"
"The productive power at mankind ’s disposal is immeasurable"
"The productivity of the soil can be increased ad infinitum by the application of capital labour and science"
"According to the most able economists and statisticians cf"
"I Chs 1 and 2 over populated Great Britain can be brought within ten years to produce a corn yield sufficient for a population six times its present size"
"Capital increases daily labour power grows with population and day by day science increasingly makes the forces of nature subject to man"
"This immeasurable productive capacity handled consciously and in the interest of all would soon reduce to a minimum the labour falling to the share of mankind"
"Left to competition it does the same but within a context of antitheses"
"One part of the land is cultivated in the best possible manner whilst another part in Great Britain and Ireland thirty million acres of good land lies barren"
"One part of capital circulates with colossal speed another lies dead in the chest"
"One part of the workers works fourteen or sixteen hours a day whilst another part stands idle and inactive and starves"
"Or the partition leaves this realm of simultaneity today trade is good demand is very considerable everyone works capital is turned over with miraculous speed farming flourishes the workers work themselves sick"
"The cultivation of the land is not worth the effort entire stretches of land remain untilled the flow of capital suddenly freezes the workers have no employment and the whole country labours under surplus wealth and surplus population"
"The economist can not afford to accept this exposition of the subject as correct otherwise as has been said he would have to give up his whole system of competition"
"He would have to recognise the hollowness of his antithesis of production and consumption of surplus population and surplus wealth"
"To bring fact and theory into conformity with each other since this fact simply could not be denied the population theory was invented"
"Malthus the originator of this doctrine maintains that population is always pressing on the means of subsistence that as soon as production increases population increases in the same proportion and that the inherent tendency of the population to multiply in excess of the available means of subsistence is the root of all misery and all vice"
"For when there are too many people they have to be disposed of in one way or another either they must be killed by violence or they must starve"
"But when this has happened there is once more a gap which other multipliers of the population immediately start to fill up once more and so the old misery begins all over again"
"What is more this is the case in all circumstances not only in civilised but also in primitive conditions"
"In New Holland The old name for Australia"
"with a population density of one per square mile the savages suffer just as much from over population as England"
"Or if this proves impossible then it is after all better to establish a state institution for the painless killing of the children of the poor such as Marcus"
"has suggested whereby each working class family would be allowed to have two and a half children any excess being painlessly killed"
"Charity is to be considered a crime since it supports the augmentation of the surplus population"
"Indeed it will be very advantageous to declare poverty a crime and to turn poor houses into prisons as has already happened in England as a result of the new liberal Poor Law"
"Admittedly it is true that this theory ill conforms with the Bible ’s doctrine of the perfection of God and of His creation but it is a poor refutation to enlist the Bible against facts"
"Am I to go on any longer elaborating this vile infamous theory this hideous blasphemy against nature and mankind"
"Am I to pursue its consequences any further"
"Here at last we have the immorality of the economist brought to its highest pitch"
"What are all the wars and horrors of the monopoly system compared with this theory"
"And it is just this theory which is the keystone of the liberal system of free trade whose fall entails the downfall of the entire edifice"
"For if here competition is proved to be the cause of misery poverty and crime who then will still dare to speak up for it"
"In his above mentioned work Alison has shaken the Malthusian theory by bringing in the productive power of the land and by opposing to the Malthusian principle the fact that each adult can produce more than he himself needs a fact without which mankind could not multiply indeed could not even exist if it were not so how could those still growing up live"
"But Alison does not go to the root of the matter and therefore in the end reaches the same conclusion as Malthus"
"True enough he proves that Malthus principle is incorrect but can not gainsay the facts which have impelled Malthus to his principle"
"If Malthus had not considered the matter so one sidedly he could not have failed to see that surplus population or labour power is invariably tied up with surplus wealth surplus capital and surplus landed property"
"The condition of every over populated country particularly England since the time when Malthus wrote makes this abundantly clear"
"These were the facts which Malthus ought to have considered in their totality and whose consideration was bound to have led to the correct conclusion"
"Instead he selected one fact gave no consideration to the others and therefore arrived at his crazy conclusion"
"The second error he committed was to confuse means of subsistence with means of employment"
"That population is always pressing on the means of employment that the number of people produced depends on the number of people who can be employed in short that the production of labour power has been regulated so far by the law of competition and is therefore also exposed to periodic crises and fluctuations this is a fact whose establishment constitutes Malthus merit"
"But the means of employment are not the means of subsistence"
"Only in their end result are the means of employment increased by the increase in machin epower and capital"
"The economist ’s demand is not the real demand his consumption is an artificial consumption"
"For the economist only that person really demands only that person is a real consumer who has an equivalent to offer for what he receives"
"But if it is a fact that every adult produces more than he himself can consume that children are like trees which give superabundant returns on the outlays invested in them and these certainly are facts are they not then it must be assumed that each worker ought to be able to produce far more than he needs and that the community therefore ought to be very glad to provide him with everything he needs one must consider a large family to be a very welcome gift for the community"
"But the economist with his crude outlook knows no other equivalent than that which is paid to him in tangible ready cash"
"We destroy the contradiction simply by transcending it"
"With the fusion of the interests now opposed to each other there disappears the contradiction between excess population here and excess wealth there there disappears the miraculous fact more miraculous than all the miracles of all the religions put together that a nation has to starve from sheer wealth and plenty and there disappears the crazy assertion that the earth lacks the power to feed men"
"This assertion is the pinnacle of Christian economics and that our economics is essentially Christian I could have proved from every proposition from every category and shall in fact do so in due course"
"The Malthusian theory is but the economic expression of the religious dogma of the contradiction of spirit and nature and the resulting corruption of both"
"As regards religion and together with religion this contradiction was resolved long ago and I hope that in the sphere of economics I have likewise demonstrated the utter emptiness of this contradiction"
"Moreover I shall not accept as competent any defence of the Malthusian theory which does not explain to me on the basis of its own principles how a people can starve from sheer plenty and bring this into harmony with reason and fact"
"At the same time the Malthusian theory has certainly been a necessary point of transition which has taken us an immense step further"
"Thanks to this theory as to economics as a whole our attention has been drawn to the productive power of the earth and of mankind and after overcoming this economic despair we have been made for ever secure against the fear of overpopulation"
"We derive from it the most powerful economic arguments for a social transformation"
"For even if Malthus were completely right this transformation would have to be undertaken straight away for only this transformation only the education of the masses which it provides makes possible that moral restraint of the propagative instinct which Malthus himself presents as the most effective and easiest remedy for overpopulation"
"Through this theory we have come to know the deepest degradation of mankind their dependence on the conditions of competition"
"It has shown us how in the last instance private property has turned man into a commodity whose production and destruction also depend solely on demand how the system of competition has thus slaughtered and daily continues to slaughter millions of men"
"All this we have seen and all this drives us to the abolition of this degradation of mankind through the abolition of private property competition and the opposing interests"
"Malthus establishes a formula on which he bases his entire system population is said to increase in a geometrical progression 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 etc"
"the productive power of the land in an arithmetical progression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6"
"Where has it been proved that the productivity of the land increases in an arithmetical progression"
"The extent of land is limited"
"The labour power to be employed on this land surface increases with population"
"Even if we assume that the increase in yield due to increase in labour does not always rise in proportion to the labour there still remains a third element which admittedly never means anything to the economist science whose progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population"
"What progress does the agriculture of this century owe to chemistry alone indeed to two men alone Sir Humphry Davy and Justus Liebig"
"But science increases at least as much as population"
"And what is impossible to science"
"But it is absurd to talk of over population so long as there is enough waste land in the valley of the Mississippi for the whole population of Europe to be transplanted there"
"so long as no more than one third of the earth can be considered cultivated and so long as the production of this third itself can be raised sixfold and more by the application of improvements already known"
"Thus competition sets capital against capital labour against labour landed property against landed property and likewise each of these elements against the other two"
"In the struggle the stronger wins and in order to predict the outcome of the struggle we shall have to investigate the strength of the contestants"
"First of all labour is weaker than either landed property or capital for the worker must work to live whilst the landowner can live on his rent and the capitalist on his interest or if the need arises on his capital or on capitalised property in land"
"The result is that only the very barest necessities the mere means of subsistence fall to the lot of labour whilst the largest part of the products is shared between capital and landed property"
"Moreover the stronger worker drives the weaker out of the market just as larger capital drives out smaller capital and larger landed property drives out smaller landed property"
"Practice confirms this conclusion"
"The advantages which the larger manufacturer and merchant enjoy over the smaller and the big landowner over the owner of a single acre are well known"
"The result is that already under ordinary conditions in accordance with the law of the stronger large capital and large landed property swallow small capital and small landed property i.e. centralisation of property"
"In crises of trade and agriculture this centralisation proceeds much more rapidly"
"In general large property increases much more rapidly than small property since a much smaller portion is deducted from its proceeds as property expenses"
"The middle classes must increasingly disappear until the world is divided into millionaires and paupers into large landowners and poor farm labourers"
"All the laws all the dividing of landed property all the possible splitting up of capital are of no avail this result must and will come unless it is anticipated by a total transformation of social conditions a fusion of opposed interests an abolition of private property"
"Free competition the keyword of our present day economists is an impossibility"
"Monopoly at least intended to protect the consumer against fraud even if it could not in fact do so"
"The abolition of monopoly however opens the door wide to fraud"
"You say that competition carries with it the remedy for fraud since no one will buy bad articles"
"Hence the necessity for monopoly which many articles in fact reveal"
"Pharmacies etc must have a monopoly"
"And the most important article money requires a monopoly most of all"
"Whenever the circulating medium has ceased to be a state monopoly it has invariably produced a trade crisis and the English economists Dr. Wade among them do concede in this case the necessity for monopoly"
"One can take one ’s stand on either side of the question the one is as difficult as the other"
"Monopoly produces free competition and the latter in turn produces monopoly"
"Therefore both must fall and these difficulties must be resolved through the transcendence of the principle which gives rise to them"
"Competition has penetrated all the relationships of our life and completed the reciprocal bondage in which men now hold themselves"
"Competition is the great mainspring which again and again jerks into activity our aging and withering social order or rather disorder but with each new exertion it also saps a part of this order ’s waning strength"
"Competition governs the numerical advance of mankind it likewise governs its moral advance"
"Anyone who has any knowledge of the statistics of crime must have been struck by the peculiar regularity with which crime advances year by year and with which certain causes produce certain crimes"
"The extension of the factory system is followed everywhere by an increase in crime"
"The number of arrests of criminal cases indeed the number of murders burglaries petty thefts etc for a large town or for a district can be predicted year by year with unfailing precision as has been done often enough in England"
"This regularity proves that crime too is governed by competition that society creates a demand for crime which is met by a corresponding supply that the gap created by the arrest transportation or execution of a certain number is at once filled by others just as every gap in population is at once filled by new arrivals in other words that crime presses on the means of punishment just as the people press on the means of employment"
"How just it is to punish criminals under these circumstances quite apart from any other considerations I leave to the judgment of my readers"
"In the struggle of capital and land against labour the first two elements enjoy yet another special advantage over labour the assistance of science for in present conditions science too is directed against labour"
"Almost all mechanical inventions for instance have been occasioned by the lack of labour power in particular Hargreaves Crompton ’s and Arkwright ’s cotton spinning machines"
"There has never been an intense demand for labour which did not result in an invention that increased labour productivity considerably thus diverting demand away from human labour"
"The history of England from 1770 until now is a continuous demonstration of this"
"The last great invention in cotton spinning the self acting mule was occasioned solely by the demand for labour and rising wages"
"It doubled machine labour and thereby cut down hand labour by half it threw half the workers out of employment and thereby reduced the wages of the others by half it crushed a plot of the workers against the factory owners and destroyed the last vestige of strength with which labour had still held out in the unequal struggle against capital"
"Dr. Ure Philosophy of Manufactures Vol 2"
"The economist now says however that in its final result machinery is favourable to the workers since it makes production cheaper and thereby creates a new and larger market for its products and thus ultimately reemploys the workers put out of work"
"But is the economist forgetting then that the production of labour power is regulated by competition that labour power is always pressing on the means of employment and that therefore when these advantages are due to become operative a surplus of competitors for work is already waiting for them and will thus render these advantages illusory whilst the disadvantages the sudden withdrawal of the means of subsistence from one half of the workers and the fall in wages for the other half are not illusory"
"Is the economist forgetting that the progress of invention never stands still and that these disadvantages therefore perpetuate themselves"
"Is he forgetting that with the division of labour developed to such a high degree by our civilisation a worker can only live if he can be used at this particular machine for this particular detailed operation that the change over from one type of employment to another newer type is almost invariably an absolute impossibility for the adult worker"
"In turning my attention to the effects of machinery I am brought to another subject less directly relevant the factory system and I have neither the inclination nor the time to treat this here"
"Besides I hope to have an early opportunity to expound in detail the despicable immorality of this system and to expose mercilessly the economist ’s hypocrisy which here appears in all its brazenness"
"Frederick Engels in Manchester Index for Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher | Index for 1844 | Marx Engels Archive"
"The axioms which qualify as robbery the landowner ’s method of deriving an income namely that each has a right to the product of his labour or that no one shall reap where he has not sown are not advanced by us"
"The first excludes the duty of feeding children the second deprives each generation of the right to live since each generation starts with what it inherits from the preceding generation"
"These axioms are rather consequences of private property"
"One should either put into effect the consequences or abandon private property as a premise"
"Indeed the original act of appropriation itself is justified by the assertion of the still earlier existence of common property rights"
"Thus wherever we turn private property leads us into contradictions"
"To make land an object of huckstering the land which is our one and all the first condition of our existence was the last step towards making oneself an object of huckstering"
"It was and is to this very day an immorality surpassed only by the immorality of self alienation"
"And the original appropriation the monopolisation of the land by a few the exclusion of the rest from that which is the condition of their life yields nothing in immorality to the subsequent huckstering of the land"
"If here again we abandon private property rent is reduced to its truth to the rational notion which essentially lies at its root"
"We have seen that capital and labour are initially identical we see further from the explanations of the economist himself that in the process of production capital the result of labour is immediately transformed again into the substratum into the material of labour and that therefore the momentarily postulated separation of capital from labour is immediately superseded by the unity of both"
"And yet the economist separates capital from labour and yet clings to the division without giving any other recognition to their unity than by his definition of capital as stored up labour"
"The split between capital and labour resulting from private property is nothing but the inner dichotomy of labour corresponding to this divided condition and arising out of it"
"And after this separation is accomplished capital is divided once more into the original capital and profit the increment of capital which it receives in the process of production although in practice profit is immediately lumped together with capital and set into motion with it"
"In the case of interest the absurdity of these splits is carried to the extreme"
"The immorality of lending at interest of receiving without working merely for making a loan though already implied in private property is only too obvious and has long ago been recognised for what it is by unprejudiced popular consciousness which in such matters is usually right"
"All these subtle splits and divisions stem from the original separation of capital from labour and from the culmination of this separation the division of mankind into capitalists and workers a division which daily becomes ever more acute and which as we shall see is bound to deepen"
"This separation however like the separation already considered of land from capital and labour is in the final analysis an impossible separation"
"What share land capital and labour each have in any particular product can not be determined"
"The three magnitudes are incommensurable"
"The land produces the raw material but not without capital and labour"
"The functions of these three elements are completely different and are not to be measured by a fourth common standard"
"Therefore when it comes to dividing the proceeds among the three elements under existing conditions there is no inherent standard it is an entirely alien and with regard to them fortuitous standard that decides"
"competition the cunning right of the stronger"
"Rent implies competition profit on capital is solely determined by competition and the position with regard to wages we shall see presently"
"If we abandon private property then all these unnatural divisions disappear"
"The difference between interest and profit disappears capital is nothing without labour without movement"
"The significance of profit is reduced to the weight which capital carries in the determination of the costs of production and profit thus remains inherent in capital in the same way as capital itself reverts to its original unity with labour"
"If we do away with private property this unnatural separation also disappears"
"Labour becomes its own reward and the true significance of the wages of labour hitherto alienated comes to light namely the significance of labour for the determination of the production costs of a thing"
"We have seen that in the end everything comes down to competition so long as private property exists"
"It is the economist ’s principal category his most beloved daughter whom he ceaselessly caresses and look out for the Medusa ’s head which she will show you"
"The immediate consequence of private property was the split of production into two opposing sides the natural and the human sides the soil which without fertilisation by man is dead and sterile and human activity the first condition of which is that very soil"
"Furthermore we have seen how human activity in its turn was dissolved into labour and capital and how these two sides antagonistically confronted each other"
"Thus we already had the struggle of the three elements against one another instead of their mutual support now we have to add that private property brings in its wake"
"the fragmentation of each of these elements"
"In other words because private property isolates everyone in his own crude solitariness and because nevertheless everyone has the same interest as his neighbour one landowner stands antagonistically confronted by another one capitalist by another one worker by another"
"In this discord of identical interests resulting precisely from this identity is consummated the immorality of mankind ’s condition hitherto and this consummation is competition"
"The opposite of competition is monopoly"
"Monopoly was the war cry of the Mercantilists competition the battle cry of the liberal economists"
"It is easy to see that this antithesis is again a quite hollow antithesis"
"Every competitor can not but desire to have the monopoly be he worker capitalist or landowner"
"Each smaller group of competitors can not but desire to have the monopoly for itself against all others"
"Competition is based on self interest and self interest in turn breeds monopoly"
"In short competition passes over into monopoly"
"On the other hand monopoly can not stem the tide of competition indeed it itself breeds competition just as a prohibition of imports for instance or high tariffs positively breed the competition of smuggling"
"It is in the interest of each to possess everything but in the interest of the whole that each possess an equal amount"
"Thus the general and the individual interest are diametrically opposed to each other"
"The contradiction of competition is that each can not but desire the monopoly whilst the whole as such is bound to lose by monopoly and must therefore remove it"
"Moreover competition already presupposes monopoly namely the monopoly of property and here the hypocrisy of the liberals comes once more to light and so long as the monopoly of property exists for so long the possession of monopoly is equally justified for monopoly once it exists is also property"
"And if we add to this the economist ’s proposition mentioned above that nothing has value which can not be monopolised that nothing therefore which does not permit of such monopolisation can enter this arena of competition then our assertion that competition presupposes monopoly is completely justified"
"The law of competition is that demand and supply always strive to complement each other and therefore never do so"
"The two sides are torn apart again and transformed into flat opposition"
"Supply always follows close on demand without ever quite covering it"
"If demand is greater than supply the price rises and as a result supply is to a certain degree stimulated"
"As soon as it comes on to the market prices fall and if it becomes greater than demand then the fall in prices is so significant that demand is once again stimulated"
"So it goes on unendingly a permanently unhealthy state of affairs a constant alternation of over stimulation and flagging which precludes all advance a state of perpetual fluctuation without ever reaching its goal"
"This law with its constant adjustment in which whatever is lost here is gained there is regarded as something excellent by the economist"
"It is his chief glory he can not see enough of it and considers it in all its possible and impossible applications"
"Yet it is obvious that this law is purely a law of nature and not a law of the mind"
"It is a law which produces revolution"
"The economist comes along with his lovely theory of demand and supply proves to you that one can never produce too much and practice replies with trade crises which reappear as regularly as the comets and of which we have now on the average one every five to seven years"
"For the last eighty years these trade crises have arrived just as regularly as the great plagues did in the past and they have brought in their train more misery and more immorality than the latter"
"Compare Wade History of the Middle and Working Classes London 1835 p. 211"
"Of course these commercial upheavals confirm the law confirm it exhaustively but in a manner different from that which the economist would have us believe to be the case"
"It is certainly a natural law based on the unconsciousness of the participants"
"If the producers as such knew how much the consumers required if they were to organise production if they were to share it out amongst themselves then the fluctuations of competition and its tendency to crisis would be impossible"
"Carry on production consciously as human beings not as dispersed atoms without consciousness of your species and you have overcome all these artificial and untenable antitheses"
"But as long as you continue to produce in the present unconscious thoughtless manner at the mercy of chance for just so long trade crises will remain and each successive crisis is bound to become more universal and therefore worse than the preceding one is bound to impoverish a larger body of small capitalists and to augment in increasing proportion the numbers of the class who live by labour alone thus considerably enlarging the mass of labour to be employed the major problem of our economists and finally causing a social revolution such as has never been dreamt of in the philosophy of the economists"
"The perpetual fluctuation of prices such as is created by the condition of competition completely deprives trade of its last vestige of morality"
"It is no longer a question of value the same system which appears to attach such importance to value which confers on the abstraction of value in money form the honour of having an existence of its own this very system destroys by means of competition the inherent value of all things and daily and hourly changes the value relationship of all things to one another"
"Where is there any possibility remaining in this whirlpool of an exchange based on a moral foundation"
"In this continuous up and down everyone must seek to hit upon the most favourable moment for purchase and sale everyone must become a speculator that is to say must reap where he has not sown must enrich himself at the expense of others must calculate on the misfortune of others or let chance win for him"
"The speculator always counts on disasters particularly on bad harvests"
"He utilises everything for instance the New York fire December 16 1835 in its time and immorality ’s culminating point is the speculation on the Stock Exchange where history and with it mankind is demoted to a means of gratifying the avarice of the calculating or gambling speculator"
"And let not the honest respectable merchant rise above the gambling on the Stock Exchange with a Pharisaic"
"I thank thee O Lord etc"
"He is as bad as the speculators in stocks and shares"
"He has to competition compels him to"
"And his trading activity therefore implies the same immorality as theirs"
"The truth of the relation of competition is the relation of consumption to productivity"
"In a world worthy of mankind there will be no other competition than this"
"The community will have to calculate what it can produce with the means at its disposal and in accordance with the relationship of this productive power to the mass of consumers it will determine how far it has to raise or lower production how far it has to give way to or curtail luxury"
"But so that they may be able to pass a correct judgment on this relationship and on the increase in productive power to be expected from a rational state of affairs within the community I invite my readers to consult the writings of the English Socialists and partly also those of Fourier"
"Subjective competition the contest of capital against capital of labour against labour etc will under these conditions be reduced to the spirit of emulation grounded in human nature a concept tolerably set forth so far only by Fourier which after the transcendence of opposing interests will be confined to its proper and rational sphere"
"The struggle of capital against capital of labour against labour of land against land drives production to a fever pitch at which production turns all natural and rational relations upside down"
"No capital can stand the competition of another if it is not brought to the highest pitch of activity"
"No piece of land can be profitably cultivated if it does not continuously increase its productivity"
"No worker can hold his own against his competitors if he does not devote all his energy to labour"
"No one at all who enters into the struggle of competition can weather it without the utmost exertion of his energy without renouncing every truly human purpose"
"When the fluctuation of competition is small when demand and supply consumption and production are almost equal a stage must be reached in the development of production where there is so much superfluous productive power that the great mass of the nation has nothing to live on that the people starve from sheer abundance"
"For some considerable time England has found herself in this crazy position in this living absurdity"
"When production is subject to greater fluctuations as it is bound to be in consequence of such a situation then the alternation of boom and crisis overproduction and slump sets in"
"The economist has never been able to find an explanation for this mad situation"
"In order to explain it he invented the population theory which is just as senseless indeed even more senseless than the contradiction of coexisting wealth and poverty"
"The economist could not afford to see the truth he could not afford to admit that this contradiction is a simple consequence of competition for in that case his entire system would have fallen to bits"
"For us the matter is easy to explain"
"The productive power at mankind ’s disposal is immeasurable"
"The productivity of the soil can be increased ad infinitum by the application of capital labour and science"
"According to the most able economists and statisticians cf"
"Alison ’s Principles of Population Vol"
"I Chs 1 and 2 over populated Great Britain can be brought within ten years to produce a corn yield sufficient for a population six times its present size"
"Capital increases daily labour power grows with population and day by day science increasingly makes the forces of nature subject to man"
"This immeasurable productive capacity handled consciously and in the interest of all would soon reduce to a minimum the labour falling to the share of mankind"
"Left to competition it does the same but within a context of antitheses"
"One part of the land is cultivated in the best possible manner whilst another part in Great Britain and Ireland thirty million acres of good land lies barren"
"One part of capital circulates with colossal speed another lies dead in the chest"
"One part of the workers works fourteen or sixteen hours a day whilst another part stands idle and inactive and starves"
"Or the partition leaves this realm of simultaneity today trade is good demand is very considerable everyone works capital is turned over with miraculous speed farming flourishes the workers work themselves sick"
"Tomorrow stagnation sets in"
"The cultivation of the land is not worth the effort entire stretches of land remain untilled the flow of capital suddenly freezes the workers have no employment and the whole country labours under surplus wealth and surplus population"
"He would have to recognise the hollowness of his antithesis of production and consumption of surplus population and surplus wealth"
"To bring fact and theory into conformity with each other since this fact simply could not be denied the population theory was invented"
"Malthus the originator of this doctrine maintains that population is always pressing on the means of subsistence that as soon as production increases population increases in the same proportion and that the inherent tendency of the population to multiply in excess of the available means of subsistence is the root of all misery and all vice"
"For when there are too many people they have to be disposed of in one way or another either they must be killed by violence or they must starve"
"But when this has happened there is once more a gap which other multipliers of the population immediately start to fill up once more and so the old misery begins all over again"
"What is more this is the case in all circumstances not only in civilised but also in primitive conditions"
"In New Holland The old name for Australia"
"with a population density of one per square mile the savages suffer just as much from over population as England"
"In short if we want to be consistent we must admit that the earth was already over populated when only one man existed"
"The implications of this line of thought are that since it is precisely the poor who are the surplus nothing should be done for them except to make their dying of starvation as easy as possible and to convince them that it can not be helped and that there is no other salvation for their whole class than keeping propagation down to the absolute minimum"
"has suggested whereby each working class family would be allowed to have two and a half children any excess being painlessly killed"
"Charity is to be considered a crime since it supports the augmentation of the surplus population"
"Indeed it will be very advantageous to declare poverty a crime and to turn poor houses into prisons as has already happened in England as a result of the new liberal Poor Law"
"Admittedly it is true that this theory ill conforms with the Bible ’s doctrine of the perfection of God and of His creation but it is a poor refutation to enlist the Bible against facts"
"Am I to go on any longer elaborating this vile infamous theory this hideous blasphemy against nature and mankind"
"Am I to pursue its consequences any further"
"Here at last we have the immorality of the economist brought to its highest pitch"
"And it is just this theory which is the keystone of the liberal system of free trade whose fall entails the downfall of the entire edifice"
"For if here competition is proved to be the cause of misery poverty and crime who then will still dare to speak up for it"
"In his above mentioned work Alison has shaken the Malthusian theory by bringing in the productive power of the land and by opposing to the Malthusian principle the fact that each adult can produce more than he himself needs a fact without which mankind could not multiply indeed could not even exist if it were not so how could those still growing up live"
"But Alison does not go to the root of the matter and therefore in the end reaches the same conclusion as Malthus"
"True enough he proves that Malthus principle is incorrect but can not gainsay the facts which have impelled Malthus to his principle"
"If Malthus had not considered the matter so one sidedly he could not have failed to see that surplus population or labour power is invariably tied up with surplus wealth surplus capital and surplus landed property"
"The population is only too large where the productive power as a whole is too large"
"These were the facts which Malthus ought to have considered in their totality and whose consideration was bound to have led to the correct conclusion"
"Instead he selected one fact gave no consideration to the others and therefore arrived at his crazy conclusion"
"The second error he committed was to confuse means of subsistence with means of employment"
"That population is always pressing on the means of employment that the number of people produced depends on the number of people who can be employed in short that the production of labour power has been regulated so far by the law of competition and is therefore also exposed to periodic crises and fluctuations this is a fact whose establishment constitutes Malthus merit"
"But the means of employment are not the means of subsistence"
"Only in their end result are the means of employment increased by the increase in machin epower and capital"
"The means of subsistence increase as soon as productive power increases even slightly"
"Here a new contradiction in economics comes to light"
"The economist ’s demand is not the real demand his consumption is an artificial consumption"
"But the economist with his crude outlook knows no other equivalent than that which is paid to him in tangible ready cash"
"He is so firmly set in his antitheses that the most striking facts are of as little concern to him as the most scientific principles"
"We destroy the contradiction simply by transcending it"
"With the fusion of the interests now opposed to each other there disappears the contradiction between excess population here and excess wealth there there disappears the miraculous fact more miraculous than all the miracles of all the religions put together that a nation has to starve from sheer wealth and plenty and there disappears the crazy assertion that the earth lacks the power to feed men"
"This assertion is the pinnacle of Christian economics and that our economics is essentially Christian I could have proved from every proposition from every category and shall in fact do so in due course"
"The Malthusian theory is but the economic expression of the religious dogma of the contradiction of spirit and nature and the resulting corruption of both"
"As regards religion and together with religion this contradiction was resolved long ago and I hope that in the sphere of economics I have likewise demonstrated the utter emptiness of this contradiction"
"Moreover I shall not accept as competent any defence of the Malthusian theory which does not explain to me on the basis of its own principles how a people can starve from sheer plenty and bring this into harmony with reason and fact"
"At the same time the Malthusian theory has certainly been a necessary point of transition which has taken us an immense step further"
"Thanks to this theory as to economics as a whole our attention has been drawn to the productive power of the earth and of mankind and after overcoming this economic despair we have been made for ever secure against the fear of overpopulation"
"We derive from it the most powerful economic arguments for a social transformation"
"For even if Malthus were completely right this transformation would have to be undertaken straight away for only this transformation only the education of the masses which it provides makes possible that moral restraint of the propagative instinct which Malthus himself presents as the most effective and easiest remedy for overpopulation"
"Through this theory we have come to know the deepest degradation of mankind their dependence on the conditions of competition"
"It has shown us how in the last instance private property has turned man into a commodity whose production and destruction also depend solely on demand how the system of competition has thus slaughtered and daily continues to slaughter millions of men"
"All this we have seen and all this drives us to the abolition of this degradation of mankind through the abolition of private property competition and the opposing interests"
"Yet so as to deprive the universal fear of overpopulation of any possible basis let us once more return to the relationship of productive power to population"
"Malthus establishes a formula on which he bases his entire system population is said to increase in a geometrical progression 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 etc"
"the productive power of the land in an arithmetical progression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6"
"The difference is obvious is terrifying but is it correct"
"Where has it been proved that the productivity of the land increases in an arithmetical progression"
"The extent of land is limited"
"The labour power to be employed on this land surface increases with population"
"Even if we assume that the increase in yield due to increase in labour does not always rise in proportion to the labour there still remains a third element which admittedly never means anything to the economist science whose progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population"
"What progress does the agriculture of this century owe to chemistry alone indeed to two men alone Sir Humphry Davy and Justus Liebig"
"The latter increases in proportion to the size of the previous generation science advances in proportion to the knowledge bequeathed to it by the previous generation and thus under the most ordinary conditions also in a geometrical progression"
"And what is impossible to science"
"But it is absurd to talk of over population so long as there is enough waste land in the valley of the Mississippi for the whole population of Europe to be transplanted there"
"so long as no more than one third of the earth can be considered cultivated and so long as the production of this third itself can be raised sixfold and more by the application of improvements already known"
"Thus competition sets capital against capital labour against labour landed property against landed property and likewise each of these elements against the other two"
"In the struggle the stronger wins and in order to predict the outcome of the struggle we shall have to investigate the strength of the contestants"
"First of all labour is weaker than either landed property or capital for the worker must work to live whilst the landowner can live on his rent and the capitalist on his interest or if the need arises on his capital or on capitalised property in land"
"The result is that only the very barest necessities the mere means of subsistence fall to the lot of labour whilst the largest part of the products is shared between capital and landed property"
"The result is that already under ordinary conditions in accordance with the law of the stronger large capital and large landed property swallow small capital and small landed property i.e. centralisation of property"
"In crises of trade and agriculture this centralisation proceeds much more rapidly"
"In general large property increases much more rapidly than small property since a much smaller portion is deducted from its proceeds as property expenses"
"The middle classes must increasingly disappear until the world is divided into millionaires and paupers into large landowners and poor farm labourers"
"All the laws all the dividing of landed property all the possible splitting up of capital are of no avail this result must and will come unless it is anticipated by a total transformation of social conditions a fusion of opposed interests an abolition of private property"
"Free competition the keyword of our present day economists is an impossibility"
"Monopoly at least intended to protect the consumer against fraud even if it could not in fact do so"
"The abolition of monopoly however opens the door wide to fraud"
"You say that competition carries with it the remedy for fraud since no one will buy bad articles"
"But that means that everyone has to be an expert in every article which is impossible"
"Hence the necessity for monopoly which many articles in fact reveal"
"Pharmacies etc must have a monopoly"
"And the most important article money requires a monopoly most of all"
"Whenever the circulating medium has ceased to be a state monopoly it has invariably produced a trade crisis and the English economists Dr. Wade among them do concede in this case the necessity for monopoly"
"But monopoly is no protection against counterfeit money"
"One can take one ’s stand on either side of the question the one is as difficult as the other"
"Monopoly produces free competition and the latter in turn produces monopoly"
"Therefore both must fall and these difficulties must be resolved through the transcendence of the principle which gives rise to them"
"Competition has penetrated all the relationships of our life and completed the reciprocal bondage in which men now hold themselves"
"Competition is the great mainspring which again and again jerks into activity our aging and withering social order or rather disorder but with each new exertion it also saps a part of this order ’s waning strength"
"Competition governs the numerical advance of mankind it likewise governs its moral advance"
"Anyone who has any knowledge of the statistics of crime must have been struck by the peculiar regularity with which crime advances year by year and with which certain causes produce certain crimes"
"The extension of the factory system is followed everywhere by an increase in crime"
"The number of arrests of criminal cases indeed the number of murders burglaries petty thefts etc for a large town or for a district can be predicted year by year with unfailing precision as has been done often enough in England"
"This regularity proves that crime too is governed by competition that society creates a demand for crime which is met by a corresponding supply that the gap created by the arrest transportation or execution of a certain number is at once filled by others just as every gap in population is at once filled by new arrivals in other words that crime presses on the means of punishment just as the people press on the means of employment"
"How just it is to punish criminals under these circumstances quite apart from any other considerations I leave to the judgment of my readers"
"Here I am merely concerned in demonstrating the extension of competition into the moral sphere and in showing to what deep degradation private property has brought man"
"In the struggle of capital and land against labour the first two elements enjoy yet another special advantage over labour the assistance of science for in present conditions science too is directed against labour"
"Almost all mechanical inventions for instance have been occasioned by the lack of labour power in particular Hargreaves Crompton ’s and Arkwright ’s cotton spinning machines"
"There has never been an intense demand for labour which did not result in an invention that increased labour productivity considerably thus diverting demand away from human labour"
"The history of England from 1770 until now is a continuous demonstration of this"
"The last great invention in cotton spinning the self acting mule was occasioned solely by the demand for labour and rising wages"
"It doubled machine labour and thereby cut down hand labour by half it threw half the workers out of employment and thereby reduced the wages of the others by half it crushed a plot of the workers against the factory owners and destroyed the last vestige of strength with which labour had still held out in the unequal struggle against capital"
"Dr. Ure Philosophy of Manufactures Vol 2"
"The economist now says however that in its final result machinery is favourable to the workers since it makes production cheaper and thereby creates a new and larger market for its products and thus ultimately reemploys the workers put out of work"
"But is the economist forgetting then that the production of labour power is regulated by competition that labour power is always pressing on the means of employment and that therefore when these advantages are due to become operative a surplus of competitors for work is already waiting for them and will thus render these advantages illusory whilst the disadvantages the sudden withdrawal of the means of subsistence from one half of the workers and the fall in wages for the other half are not illusory"
"Is the economist forgetting that the progress of invention never stands still and that these disadvantages therefore perpetuate themselves"
"Is he forgetting that with the division of labour developed to such a high degree by our civilisation a worker can only live if he can be used at this particular machine for this particular detailed operation that the change over from one type of employment to another newer type is almost invariably an absolute impossibility for the adult worker"
"In turning my attention to the effects of machinery I am brought to another subject less directly relevant the factory system and I have neither the inclination nor the time to treat this here"
"Besides I hope to have an early opportunity to expound in detail the despicable immorality of this system and to expose mercilessly the economist ’s hypocrisy which here appears in all its brazenness"
"Deutsch Franz � sische Jahrb � cher The Condition of England"
"Of all the fat books and thin pamphlets which have appeared in England in the past year for the entertainment or edification of educated society the above work is the only one which is worth reading"
"All the multivolume novels with their sad and amusing intricacies all the edifying and meditative scholarly and unscholarly Bible commentaries and novels and books of edification are the two staples of English literature"
"all these you may with an easy conscience leave unread"
"Perhaps you will find some books on geology economics history or mathematics which contain a small grain of novelty however these are matters which one studies but does not read they represent dry specialised branches of science arid botanising plants whose roots were long ago torn out of the general soil of humanity from which they derived their nourishment"
"It is remarkable how greatly the upper classes of society such as the Englishman calls respectable people or the better sort of people etc have intellectually declined and lost their vigour in England"
"All energy all activity all substance are gone the landed aristocracy goes hunting the moneyed aristocracy makes entries in the ledger and at best dabbles in literature which is equally empty and insipid"
"Political and religious prejudices are inherited from one generation to another everything is now made easy and there is no longer any need to worry about principles as one had to formerly they are now picked up already in the cradle ready made one has no notion where they come from"
"What more does one need"
"One has enjoyed a good education that is one has been tormented to no avail with the Romans and Greeks at school for the rest one is respectable that is one has so many thousand pounds to one ’s name and thus does not have to bother about anything except marrying if one does not already have a wife"
"And now to cap it all this bugbear which people call intellect"
"Where should intellect come from in such a life and if it did come where might it find a home with them"
"Everything there is as fixed and formalised as in China woe be to the man who oversteps the narrow bounds woe thrice woe to the man who offends against a timehonoured prejudice nine times woe to him if it is a religious prejudice"
"For all questions they have just two answers a Whig answer and a Tory answer and these answers were long ago prescribed by the sage supreme masters of ceremony of both parties you have no need of deliberation and circumstantiality everything is cut and dried Dicky Cobden or Lord John Russell has said this and Bobby Peel or the Duke that is the Duke of Wellington has said that and that is an end of the matter"
"You good Germans are told year in year out by the liberal journalists and parliamentarians what wonderful people what independent men the English are and all on account of their free institutions and from a distance it all looks quite impressive"
"The debates in the Houses of Parliament the free press the tumultuous popular meetings the elections the jury system these can not fail to impress the timid spirit of the average German and in his astonishment he takes all these splendid appearances for true coin"
"But ultimately the position of the liberal journalist and parliamentarian is really far from being elevated enough to provide a comprehensive view whether it be of the development of mankind or just that of a single nation"
"The English that is the educated English according to whom the national character is judged on the Continent these English are the most despicable slaves under the sun"
"Only that part of the English nation which is unknown on the Continent only the workers the pariahs of England the poor are really respectable for all their roughness and for all their moral degradation"
"It is from them that England ’s salvation will come they still comprise flexible material they have no education but no prejudices either they still have the strength for a great national deed they still have a future"
"The aristocracy and nowadays that also includes the middle classes has exhausted itself such ideas as it had have been worked out and utilised to their ultimate logical limit and its rule is approaching its end with giant strides"
"The rule of public prejudice is everywhere the first consequence of socalled free political institutions and in England the politically freest country in Europe this rule is stronger than anywhere else except for North America where public prejudice is legally acknowledged as a power in the state by Iynch law"
"The Englishman crawls before public prejudice he immolates himself to it daily and the more liberal he is the more humbly does he grovel in the dust before his idol"
"Public prejudice in educated society is however either of Tory or of Whig persuasion or at best radical and even that no longer has quite the odour of propriety"
"If you should go amongst educated Englishmen and say that you are Chartists or democrats the balance of your mind will be doubted and your company fled"
"Or declare you do not believe in the divinity of Christ and you are done for if moreover you confess that you are atheists the next day people will pretend not to know you"
"And when the independent Englishman for once and this happens rarely enough really begins to think and shakes off the fetters of prejudice he has absorbed with his mother ’s milk even then he has not the courage to speak out his convictions openly even then he feigns an opinion before society that is at least tolerated and is quite content if occasionally he can discuss his views with some likeminded person in private"
"Thus the minds of the educated classes in England are closed to all progress and only kept to some degree in movement by the pressure of the working class"
"It can not be expected that the literary diet of their decrepit culture should be different from these classes themselves"
"The whole of fashionable literature moves in a neverending circle and is just as boring and sterile as this blas � and effete fashionable society"
"When Strauss Das Leben Jesu and its fame crossed the Channel no respectable man dared to translate the book nor any bookseller of repute to print it"
"Finally it was translated by a socialist lecturer"
"there is no German word for this propagandist term a man therefore in one of the world ’s least fashionable situations a small socialist printer printed it in instalments at a penny each and the workers of Manchester Birmingham and London were the only readers Strauss had in England"
"If by the way either of the two parties into which the educated section of the English people is split deserves any preference it is the Tories"
"the Whig is himself too much of an interested party to be able to judge industry that focal point of English society is in his hands and makes him rich he can find no fault in it and considers its expansion the only purpose of all legislation for it has given him his wealth and his power"
"The Tory on the other hand whose power and unchallenged dominance have been broken by industry and whose principles have been shaken by it hates it and sees in it at best a necessary evil"
"This is the reason for the formation of that group of philanthropic Tories whose chief leaders are Lord Ashley Ferrand Walter Oastler etc and who have made it their duty to take the part of the factory workers against the manufacturers"
"Thomas Carlyle too was originally a Tory and still stands closer to that party than to the Whigs"
"This much is certain a Whig would never have been able to write a book that was half so humane as Past and Present"
"Thomas Carlyle has become known in Germany through his efforts to make German literature accessible to the English"
"For several years he has been mainly occupied with the social conditions of England the only educated man of his country to do so and as early as 1838 he wrote a brief work entitled Chartism"
"At that time the Whigs were in office and proclaimed with much trumpeting that the spectre of Chartism which had arisen round 1835 was now destroyed"
"Chartism was the natural successor to the old radicalism which had been appeased for a few years by the Reform Bill and reappeared in 183536 with new strength and with its ranks more solid than ever before"
"The Whigs thought they had suppressed this Chartism and Thomas Carlyle took this as his cue to expound the real causes of Chartism and the impossibility of eradicating it before these causes were eradicated"
"It is true that as a whole the position taken by that book is the same as in Past and Present though with rather stronger Tory colouring but this is perhaps merely a result of the fact that the Whigs as the ruling party were the most open to criticism"
"At all events everything that is in the smaller book is to be found in Past and Present with greater clarity with the argument further developed and with an explicit description of the consequences and therefore makes a critical analysis of Chartism on our part superfluous"
"Past and Present is a parallel between England in the twelfth and in the nineteenth centuries and consists of four sections entitled Proem The Ancient Monk The Modern Worker and Horoscope"
"Let us consider these sections in turn I can not resist the temptation to translate the finest of the book ’s often marvellously fine passages"

"This fiat falls on the workers first"
"In 1842 England and Wales counted 1,430,000 paupers of whom 222,000 were incarcerated in workhouses Poorlaw Bastilles the common people call them"

"And so it is with nations too can you solve the riddle of destiny"
"And all unfortunate peoples like all unfortunate individuals have answered the question wrongly have taken the semblance for the truth have abandoned the eternal inner facts of the universe in favour of transient outer appearances and England too has done this"

"This is the condition of England according to Carlyle"
"An idle landowning aristocracy which have not yet learned even to sit still and do no mischief a working aristocracy submerged in Mammonism who when they ought to be collectively the leaders of labour captains of industry are just a gang of industrial buccaneers and pirates"
"A Parliament elected by bribery a philosophy of simply looking on of doing nothing of laissezfaire a wornout crumbling religion a total disappearance of all general human interests a universal despair of truth and humanity and in consequence a universal isolation of men in their own brute individuality a chaotic savage confusion of all aspects of life a war of all against all a general death of the spirit a dearth of soul that is of truly human consciousness a disproportionately strong working class in intolerable oppression and wretchedness in furious discontent and rebellion against the old social order and hence a threatening irresistibly advancing democracy"
"everywhere chaos disorder anarchy dissolution of the old ties of society everywhere intellectual insipidity frivolity and debility"

"Thus far if we discount a few expressions that have derived from Carlyle ’s particular standpoint we must allow the truth of all he says"
"He alone of the respectable class has kept his eyes open at least towards the facts he has at least correctly apprehended the immediate present and that is indeed a very great deal for an educated Englishman"
"How does the future appear"
"Matters will not and can not remain as they are now"
"In that too he is right"
"All social philosophy as long as it still propounds a few principles as its final conclusion as long as it continues to administer Morison ’s pills remains very imperfect it is not the bare conclusions of which we are in such need but rather study the conclusions are nothing without the reasoning that has led up to them this we have known since Hegel and the conclusions are worse than useless if they are final in themselves if they are not turned into premises for further deductions"
"But the conclusions must also assume a distinct form for a time they must in the course of development evolve from vague imprecision into clear ideas and then of course in the case of such an exclusively empirical nation as the English are they can not avoid becoming Morison ’s pills"
"Carlyle himself although he has absorbed much that is German and is quite far removed from crass empiricism would probably have a few pills to hand if he were less vague and hazy about the future"
"Meanwhile he declares everything to be useless and unprofitable as long as mankind persists in atheism as long as it has not recovered its soul"
"Not that traditional Catholicism can be restored in its vigour and vitality nor that today ’s religion can be maintained he knows very well that rituals dogmas litanies and Sinai thunder can not help that all the thunder of Sinai does not make the truth any truer nor does it frighten any sensible person that we are far beyond the religion of fear but religion itself must be restored we ourselves see where two centuries of Atheist Government since the blessed restoration of Charles II have brought us and we shall gradually also be obliged to recognise that this atheism is beginning to show signs of wear and tear"
"But we have seen what Carlyle calls atheism it is not so much disbelief in a personal God as disbelief in the inner essence in the infinity of the universe disbelief in reason despair of the intellect and the truth his struggle is not against disbelief in the revelation of the Bible but against the most frightful disbelief the disbelief in the Bible of Universal History"
"That is the eternal book of God in which every man while his spirit and the light of his eyes are yet with him may see God ’s finger write"
"To make mockery of this is disbelief like none other a disbelief you would punish not by burning at the stake but nevertheless with the most imperative command to keep one ’s silence until one has something better to say"

"In order to effect this organisation in order to put true guidance and true government in the place of false guidance Carlyle longs for a true aristocracy a heroworship and puts forward the second great problem to discover the a’ptg"
"or the best whose task it is to combine with inevitable Democracy indispensable Sovereignty"
"From these excerpts Carlyle ’s position emerges fairly clearly"
"The English have no pantheism but merely scepticism the conclusion of all English philosophising is the despair of reason the confessed inability to solve the contradictions with which one is ultimately faced and consequently on the one hand a relapse into faith and on the other devotion to pure practice without a further thought for metaphysics etc"
"Carlyle with his pantheism derived from German literature is therefore a phenomenon in England and for the practical and sceptical English a pretty incomprehensible one"
"People gape at him speak of German mysticism and distorted English others claim there is at bottom something in it his English though unusual"
"he is a prophet etc"
"but nobody really knows what to make of it all"
"For us Germans who know the antecedents of Carlyle ’s position the matter is clear enough"
"On the one hand vestiges of Tory romanticism and humane attitudes originating with Goethe and on the other scepticalempirical England these factors are sufficient for one to deduce the whole of Carlyle ’s view of the world from them"
"With Schelling that is to say with the old Schelling not the Schelling of the philosophy of revelation Carlyle really has a great deal in common with Strauss whose outlook is similarly pantheistic he is on common ground in his heroworship or cult of genius"
"The critique of pantheism has recently been so exhaustively set forth in Germany that little more remains to be said"
"Feuerbach ’s These s in the Anekdota and Bruno Bauer ’s works contain all the relevant material"
"We will therefore be able to confine ourselves simply to following up the implications of Carlyle ’s position and showing that it is basically only a first step towards the position adopted by this journal"
"Carlyle complains about the emptiness and hollowness of the age about the inner rottenness of all social institutions"
"The complaint is fair but by simply complaining one does not dispose of the matter in order to redress the evil its cause must be discovered and if Carlyle had done this he would have found that this desultoriness and hollowness this soullessness this irreligion and this atheism have their roots in religion itself"
"Religion by its very essence drains man and nature of substance and transfers this substance to the phantom of an otherworldly God who in turn then graciously permits man and nature to receive some of his superfluity"
"Now as long as faith in this otherworldly phantom is vigorous and alive thus long man will acquire in this roundabout way at least some substance"
"The strong faith of the Middle Ages did indeed give the whole epoch considerable energy in this way but it was energy that did not come from without but was already present within human nature though as yet unperceived and undeveloped"
"Faith gradually weakened religion crumbled in the face of the rising level of civilisation but still man did not perceive that he had worshipped and deified his own being in the guise of a being outside himself"
"Lacking awareness and at the same time faith man can have no substance he is bound to despair of truth reason and nature and this hollowness and lack of substance the despair of the eternal facts of the universe will last until mankind perceives that the being it has worshipped as God was its own as yet unknown being until but why should I copy Feuerbach"
"The hollowness has long been there for religion represents man ’s action of making himself hollow and you are surprised that now when the purple that concealed it has faded when the fog that enveloped it has passed away that now to your consternation it emerges in the full light of day"
"Carlyle accuses the age furthermore this is the immediate consequence of the foregoing of hypocrisy and lying"
"Naturally the hollowness and enervation must be decently concealed and kept upright by accessories padded clothes and whalebone stays"
"We too attack the hypocrisy of the present Christian state of the world the struggle against it our liberation from it and the liberation of the world from it are ultimately our sole occupation but"
"This hypocrisy is traced back by us to religion the first word of which is a lie or does religion not begin by showing us something human and claiming it is something superhuman something divine"
"But because we know that all this Lying and immorality follows from religion that religious hypocrisy theology is the archetype of all other lies and hypocrisy we are justified in extending the term theology to the whole untruth and hypocrisy of the present as was originally done by Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer"
"Carlyle should read their works if he wishes to know the origin of the immorality that plagues our whole society"
"A new religion a pantheistic heroworship a cult of work ought to be set up or is to be expected but this is impossible all the possibilities of religion are exhausted after Christianity after absolute i.e. abstract religion after religion as such no other form of religion can arise"
"Carlyle himself realises that Catholic Protestant or any other kind of Christianity is irresistibly moving towards its downfall if he knew the nature of Christianity he would realise that after it no other religion is possible"
"Pantheism itself is another consequence of Christianity and can not be divorced from its antecedent at least that is true of modern pantheism of Spinoza ’s Schelling ’s Hegel ’s and also Carlyle ’s pantheism"
"Once more Feuerbach relieves me of the trouble of providing proof of this"
"As I have said we too are concerned with combating the lack of principle the inner emptiness the spiritual deadness the untruthfulness of the age we are waging a war to the death against all these things just as Carlyle is and there is a much greater probability that we shall succeed than that he will because we know what we want"
"We want to put an end to atheism as Carlyle portrays it by giving back to man the substance he has lost through religion not as divine but as human substance and this whole process of giving back is no more than simply the awakening of selfconsciousness"
"We want to sweep away everything that claims to be supernatural and superhuman and thereby get rid of untruthfulness for the root of all untruth and Lying is the pretension of the human and the natural to be superhuman and supernatural"
"For that reason we have once and for all declared war on religion and religious ideas and care little whether we are called atheists or anything else"
"If however Carlyle ’s pantheistic definition of atheism were correct it is not we but our Christian opponents who would be the true atheists"
"We have no intention of attacking the eternal inner Facts of the universe on the contrary we have for the first time truly substantiated them by proving their perpetuity and rescuing them from the omnipotent arbitrariness of an inherently selfcontradictory God"
"We have no intention of pronouncing the world man and his life a lie on the contrary our Christian opponents are guilty of this act of immorality when they make the world and man dependent on the grace of a God who in reality was only created from the reflected image of man in the crude hyle of his own undeveloped consciousness"
"We have no intention whatever of doubting or despising the revelation of history for history is all and everything to us"
"and we hold it more highly than any other previous philosophical trend more highly than Hegel even who after all used it only as a case against which to test his logical problem"
"It is the other side that scorns history and disregards the development of mankind it is the Christians again who by putting forward a separate History of the Kingdom of God deny that real history has any inner substantiality and claim that this substantiality belongs exclusively to"
"their otherworldly abstract and what is more fictitious history who by asserting that the culmination of the human species is their Christ make history attain an imaginary goal interrupt it in midcourse and are now obliged if only for the sake of consistency to declare the following eighteen hundred years to be totally nonsensical and utterly meaningless"
"We lay claim to the meaning of history but we see in history not the revelation of God but of man and only of man"
"We have no need in order to see the splendour of the human character in order to recognise the development of the human species through history its irresistible progress its evercertain victory over the unreason of the individual its overcoming of all that is apparently supernatural its hard but successful struggle against nature until the final achievement of free human self consciousness the discernment of the unity of man and nature and the independent creation voluntarily and by its own effort of a new world based on purely human and moral social relationships in order to recognise all that in its greatness we have no need first to summon up the abstraction of a God and to attribute to it everything beautiful great sublime and truly human we do not need to follow this roundabout path we do not need first to imprint the stamp of the divine on what is truly human in order to be sure of its greatness and splendour"
"On the contrary the more divine in other words the more inhuman something is the less we shall be able to admire it"
"Only the human origin of the content of all religions still preserves for them here"
"and there some claim to respect only the consciousness that even the wildest superstition nevertheless has within it at bottom the eternal determinants of human nature in however dislocated and distorted a form"
"The more godly they are the more inhuman the more bestial and the godly Middle Ages did indeed produce the culmination of human bestiality serfdom jus primae noctis etc"
"The godlessness of our age of which Carlyle so much complains is precisely its saturation with God"
"From this it also becomes clear why above I gave man as the solution to the riddle of the Sphinx"
"Man has only to understand himself to take himself as the measure of all aspects of life to judge according to his being to organise the world in a truly human manner according to the demands of his own nature and he will have solved the riddle of our time"
"Not in otherworldly nonexistent regions not beyond time and space not with a God immanent in or opposed to the world is the truth to be found but much nearer in man ’s own breast"
"Man ’s own substance is far more splendid and sublime than the imaginary substance of any conceivable God who is after all only the more or less indistinct and distorted image of man himself"
"So when Carlyle follows Ben Jonson in saying man has lost his soul and is only now beginning to notice the want of it the right formulation would be in religion man has lost his own substance has alienated his humanity and now that religion through the progress of history has begun to totter he notices his emptiness and instability"
"But there is no other salvation for him"
"he can not regain his humanity his substance other than by thoroughly overcoming all religious ideas and returning firmly and honestly not to God but to himself"
"All of this may also be found in Goethe the prophet and anyone who has his eyes open can read this between the lines"
"Neither the ancients nor Shakespeare can measure up to him in this respect"
"What Goethe could only express spontaneously and therefore it is true in a certain sense prophetically has been developed and substantiated in contemporary German philosophy"
"Carlyle too embodies assumptions which logically must lead to the position set forth above"
"Pantheism itself is but the last preliminary step towards a free and human point of view"
"History which Carlyle presents as the real revelation contains only what is human and only by an arbitrary act can its content be taken away from humanity and credited to the account of a God"
"Work free activity in which Carlyle similarly sees a cult is again a purely human matter and can only be linked with God in an arbitrary manner"
"What is the point of continually pushing to the fore a word which at best only expresses the boundlessness of indetermination and what is more maintains the illusion of dualism a word which in itself is the denial of nature and humanity"
"So much for the inward religious aspect of Carlyle ’s standpoint"
"It serves as a point of departure for the assessment of the outward politicosocial aspect Carlyle has still enough religion to remain in a state of unfreedom pantheism still recognises something higher than man himself"
"Hence his longing for a true aristocracy for heroes as if these heroes could at best be more than men"
"If he had understood man as man in all his infinite complexity he would not have conceived the idea of once more dividing mankind into two lots sheep and goats rulers and ruled aristocrats and the rabble lords and dolts he would have seen the proper social function of talent not in ruling by force but in acting as a stimulant and taking the lead"
"Mankind is surely not passing through democracy to arrive back eventually at the point of departure"
"What Carlyle says about democracy incidentally leaves little to be desired if we discount what we have just been referring to his lack of clarity about the goal the purpose of modern democracy"
"Democracy true enough is only a transitional stage though not towards a new improved aristocracy but towards real human freedom just as the irreligiousness of the age will eventually lead to complete emancipation from everything that is religious superhuman and supernatural and not to its restoration"
"Carlyle recognises the inadequacy of competition demand and supply Mammonism etc and is far removed from asserting the absolute justification of landownership"
"How does he think he will destroy competition supply and demand Mammonism etc as long as the root of all these things private property exists"
"Organisation of labour can not help in this respect it can not even be applied without a certain identity of interests"
"Why then does he not act consistently and decisively proclaiming the identity of interests the only truly human state of affairs and thereby putting an end to all difficulties all imprecision and lack of clarity"
"In all Carlyle ’s rhapsodies there is not a syllable mentioning the English Socialists"
"As long as he adheres to his present point of view which is admittedly infinitely far in advance of that of the mass of educated people in England but still abstract and theoretical he will indeed not be able to view their efforts with particular sympathy"
"The English Socialists are purely practical and therefore also propose remedies homecolonies etc rather in the manner of Morison ’s pills their philosophy is truly English sceptical in other words they despair of theory and for all practical purposes they cling to the materialism upon which their whole social system is based all this will have little appeal for Carlyle but he is as onesided as they"
"Both have only overcome the contradiction within the contradiction the Socialists within the sphere of practice Carlyle within the sphere of theory and even there only spontaneously whereas the Socialists by means of reasoning have definitely overcome the practical aspect of the contradiction"
"The Socialists are still Englishmen when they ought to be simply men of philosophical developments on the Continent they are only acquainted with materialism but not with German philosophy that is their only shortcoming and they are directly engaged on the rectification of this deficiency by working for the removal of national differences"
"But in any case they are the only party in England which has a future relatively weak though they may be"
"Democracy Chartism must soon be victorious and then the mass of the English workers will have the choice only between starvation and socialism"
"For Carlyle and his standpoint ignorance of German philosophy is not a matter of such indifference"
"He is himself a theoretician of the German type and yet at the same time his nationality leads him to empiricism he is beset by a flagrant contradiction which can only be resolved if he continues to develop his German theoretical viewpoint to its final conclusion until it is totally reconciled with empiricism"
"To surmount the contradiction in which he is working Carlyle has only one more step to take but as all experience in Germany has shown it is a difficult one"
"Let us hope that he will take it and although he is no longer young he will still probably be capable of it for the progress shown in his last book proves that his views are still developing"
"All this shows that Carlyle ’s book is ten thousand times more worth translating into German than all the legions of English novels which every day and every hour are imported into Germany and I can only advocate such a translation"
"But let our hack translators just keep their hands off it"
"Following this somewhat general introduction I shall examine in greater detail in the following numbers of this journal the condition of England and the essential part of it the condition of the working class"
"The condition of England is of immense importance for history and for all other countries for as regards social matters England is of course far in advance of all other countries"

"The century of revolution has to all appearances passed England by causing little change"
"While on the Continent an entire old world was shattered while a twenty five year war 201 cleared the air in England everything remained calm neither state nor church were in any way threatened"
"And yet since the middle of the last century England has experienced a greater upheaval than any other country an upheaval which is all the more momentous the more quietly it is brought about and it will therefore in all probability attain its goal more readily in practice than the political revolution in France or the philosophical revolution in Germany"
"The revolution in England is a social one and therefore more comprehensive and far reaching than any other"
"There are no fields however remote of human knowledge and no conditions of life which have not contributed to it and which in turn have not been affected by it"
"The only true revolution is a social revolution to which political and philosophical revolution must lead and this social revolution has already been in progress in England for seventy or eighty years and is rapidly approaching its crisis at this very time"
"The eighteenth century was the assembling the gathering of mankind from the fragmentation and isolation into which it had been driven by Christianity it was the penultimate step towards the self understanding and self liberation of mankind but just because it was the penultimate step it was still partial and remained within the contradictions"
"The eighteenth century collated the results of the past which had previously been scattered and appeared to be fortuitous and laid bare their necessity and inner connection"
"Before the eighteenth century science did not exist the study of nature assumed its scientific form only in the eighteenth century or in some fields a few years earlier"
"Newton created scientific astronomy with the law of gravitation scientific optics with the decomposition of light scientific mathematics with the binomial theorem and the theory of infinity and scientific mechanics with the analysis of the nature of forces"
"Physics likewise acquired its scientific character in the eighteenth century chemistry was only brought into being by Black Lavoisier and Priestley geography became a science with the establishment of the form of the earth and the many voyages which only now were of benefit to science with Buffon and Linn � natural history too became a science even geology gradually began to struggle free from the whirl of fantastic hypotheses which threatened to engulf it"
"The concept of the Encyclopaedia was typical of the eighteenth century it was based on the awareness that all these sciences were interconnected but it was not yet able to show these connections so that only a simple juxtaposition could be achieved"
"History was in a similar position now for the first time we find voluminous compilations of world history as yet without any critical comment and entirely without a philosophical approach but nevertheless universal history instead of the previous historical fragments limited both in time and place"
"Politics was given a human foundation and political economy was reformed by Adam Smith"
"The culmination of science in the eighteenth century was materialism the first system of natural philosophy and the consequence of this development of the natural sciences"
"The struggle against the abstract subjectivity of Christianity forced the philosophy of the eighteenth century to the other extreme it opposed subjectivity with objectivity the mind with nature spiritualism with materialism the abstract individual with the abstract universal or substance"
"Materialism and the republic the philosophy and politics of the ancient world arose anew and the French the exponents of the ethos of antiquity within Christianity assumed the historical initiative for a time"
"The eighteenth century thus did not resolve the great antithesis which has been the concern of history from the beginning and whose development constitutes history the antithesis of substance and subject nature and mind necessity and freedom but it set the two sides against each other fully developed and in all their sharpness and thereby made it necessary to overcome the antithesis"
"The consequence Of this clear final evolution of the antithesis was general revolution which spread over various nations and whose imminent completion will at the same time resolve the antithesis of history up to the present"
"The Germans the nation of Christian spiritualism experienced a philosophical revolution the French the nation of classical materialism and hence of politics had to go through a political revolution the English a nation that is a mixture of German and French elements who therefore embody both sides of the antithesis and are for that reason more universal than either of the two factors taken separately were for that reason drawn into a more universal a social revolution"
"This will need to be elaborated in greater detail for the position of nations at least with regard to recent times has in our philosophy of history so far been dealt with very inadequately or rather not at all"
"That Germany France and England are the three foremost countries at the present moment in history I can doubtless take for granted that the Germans represent the Christian spiritual principle the French that of classical materialism in other words that the former represent religion and the church and the latter politics and the state is equally obvious or will be made so in due course the significance of the English in recent history is less conspicuous and yet for our present purpose"
"it is the most important"
"The English nation was formed from Germanic and Romance people at a time when the two nations had only just separated from one another and their development towards the two sides of the antithesis had scarcely begun"
"The Germanic and Romance elements developed alongside one another and eventually formed one nation which contains the two unmediated sides"
"In a similar fashion Romance materialism turned into abstract idealism inwardness and piety hence the phenomenon of Romance Catholicism persisting within Germanic Protestantism the Established Church the papacy of the sovereign and the thoroughly Catholic manner of disposing of religion with mere formalities"
"The English nation is characterised by this unresolved contradiction and the mingling of the sharpest contrasts"
"The English are the most religious nation on earth and at the same time the most irreligious they worry more about the next world than any other nation and at the same time they live as though this world were all that mattered to them their expectation of heaven does not hinder them in the slightest from believing equally firmly in the hell of making no money and in the everlasting inner restlessness of the English which is caught up in the sense of being unable to resolve the contradiction and which drives them out of themselves and into activity"
"The sense of contradiction is the source of energy but merely external energy and this sense of contradiction was the source of colonisation seafaring industry and the immense practical activity of the English in general"
"The inability to resolve the contradiction runs like a thread through the whole of English philosophy and forces it into empiricism and scepticism"
"Because Bacon could not resolve the contradiction between idealism and realism with his intellect the intellect as such had to be incapable of solving it idealism was simply discarded and empiricism regarded as the only remedy"
"Humean scepticism is still the form all irreligious philosophising takes in England today"
"We can not know this viewpoint argues whether a God exists if one exists he is incapable of any communication with us and we have therefore so to arrange our practical affairs as if he did not exist"
"We can not know whether the mind is distinct from the body and immortal we therefore live as if this life were the only one we have and do not bother about things that go beyond our understanding"
"In short this scepticism is in practice exactly the same as French materialism but in metaphysical theory it never advances beyond the inability of arriving at any definitive conclusion"
"However because the English embodied within them both the elements which were responsible for historical progress on the Continent they were therefore able even without having much contact with the Continent to keep abreast of development there and at times even to be ahead of it"
"The English revolution of the seventeenth century provides the exact model for the French one of 1789"
"In the Long Parliament the three stages which in France took the form of Constituent and Legislative Assembly and National Convention are easy to distinguish the transition from constitutional monarchy to democracy military despotism restoration and juste milieu revolution"
"The French revolution of July 1830 is sharply delineated in the English revolution"
"Cromwell is Robespierre and Napoleon rolled into one the Presbyterians Independents and Levellers correspond to the Gironde the Montagnards and the H � bertists and Babeuvists in both cases the political outcome is rather pitiable and the whole parallel which could be elaborated in much greater detail incidentally also proves that a religious and an irreligious revolution as long as they remain political will in the final analysis amount to the same thing"
"Admittedly this lead the English had over the Continent was only temporary and was gradually evened out again the English revolution ended in juste milieu and the creation of two national parties whilst the French one is not yet complete and can not be so until it achieves the result which the German philosophical and the English social revolutions have to achieve as well"
"The English national character is thus substantially different both from the German and from the French character the despair of overcoming the contradiction and the consequent total surrender to empiricism are its peculiar characteristics"
"The pure Germanic element converted its abstract inwardness into abstract outwardness but this outwardness never lost the mark of its origin and always remained subordinate to inwardness and spiritualism"
"The French too are to be found on the side of materialism and empiricism but because this empiricism is the primary national tendency and not a secondary consequence of a national consciousness divided within itself it asserts itself nationally generally and finds expression in political activity"
"The Germans asserted the absolute justification of spiritualism and hence sought to set forth the universal interests of mankind in religious and later in philosophic terms"
"The French opposed this spiritualism with materialism as something absolutely justified and consequently considered that the state was the eternal manifestation of these interests"
"The English however have no universal interests they can not mention them without touching that sore spot the contradiction they despair of them and have only individual interests"
"This absolute subjectivity the fragmentation of the universal into the many individual parts is admittedly of Germanic origin but as we have said it is cut off from its roots and therefore only takes effect empirically which is precisely what distinguishes English social empiricism from French political empiricism"
"France ’s actions were always national conscious of their entireness and universality from the start"
"England ’s actions were the work of independent coexisting individuals the movement of disconnected atoms who rarely acted together as one whole and even then only from individual motives and whose lack of unity is at this very time exposed to the light of day in the universal misery and complete fragmentation of society"
"In other words only England has a social history"
"Only in England have individuals as such without consciously standing for universal principles furthered national development and brought it near to its conclusion"
"Only here have the masses acted as masses for the sake of their interests as individuals only here have principles been turned into interests before they were able to influence history"
"The French and the Germans are gradually attaining a social history too but they have not got one yet"
"On the Continent the social aspect is still completely hidden by the political aspect and has not yet become detached from it whilst in England the social aspect has gradually prevailed over the political one and has made it subservient"
"The whole of English politics is fundamentally social in nature and social questions are expressed in a political way only because England has not yet advanced beyond the state and because politics is a necessary expedient there"
"As long as church and state are the only forms in which the universal characteristics of human nature are realised there can be no question of social history"
"Antiquity and the Middle Ages were also therefore without social development only the Reformation the first as yet biased and blundering attempt at a reaction against the Middle Ages brought about a major social change the transformation of serfs into free workers"
"But even this change remained without much enduring effect on the Continent indeed it really took root there only after the revolution of the eighteenth century whereas in England the category of serfs was transformed during the Reformation into villeins bordars and cottars and thus into a class of workers enjoying personal freedom 202 and as early as the eighteenth century the consequences of this revolution became evident there"
"Why this happened only in England is explained above"
"Antiquity which as yet knew nothing of the rights of the individual whose whole outlook was essentially abstract universal and material could therefore not exist without slavery"
"The Christian Germanic view of the world by contrast with antiquity set up abstract subjectivity and hence arbitrariness inwardness and spiritualism as the basic principle"
"However this subjectivity precisely because it was abstract and one sided was bound to turn at once into its opposite and to engender not the freedom of the individual but the enslavement of the individual"
"Abstract inwardness became abstract outwardness the rejection and alienation of man and the first consequence of the new principle was the restoration of slavery in another form that of serfdom which was less offensive but for that reason hypocritical and more inhuman"
"The dissolution of the feudal system the political Reformation in other words the apparent acknowledgment of reason and hence really the culmination of unreason appeared to abolish this serfdom but in reality only made it more inhuman and more universal"
"It was the first to declare that mankind should no longer be held together by force that is by political means but by self interest that is by social means and through this new principle it laid the foundation for social advance"
"But although it thus negated the state on the other hand it actually revived the state by restoring to it the content which had previously been usurped by the church and thus gave the state which in the Middle Ages had been an empty form of little consequence the strength for further development"
"The Christian state the culmination of the political aspect of the Christian world order arose from the ruins of feudalism another aspect of the Christian world order attained its culmination by elevating interestedness to a general principle"
"For interest is essentially subjective and egoistical it is the interest of the individual and as such the highest point of the Germanic and Christian principle of subjectivity and particularisation"
"The consequence of elevating interest to the nexus of man to man that is as long as interest remains directly subjective and purely egoistical is bound to be universal fragmentation the concentration of each individual upon himself isolation the transformation of mankind into a collection of mutually repelling atoms and this particularisation is again the ultimate consequence of the Christian principle of subjectivity the culmination of the Christian world order"
"Moreover as long as private property the basic form of alienation exists interest must necessarily be the interest of the individual and its domination will be the domination of property"
"The abolition of feudal servitude has made cash payment the sole relation of human beings"
"Thomas Carlyle Past and Present p. 198 Property a natural spiritless principle as opposed to the human and spiritual principle is thus enthroned and ultimately to complete this alienation money the alienated empty abstraction of property is made master of the world"
"Man has ceased to be the slave of men and has become the slave of things the perversion of the human condition is complete the servitude of the modern commercial world this highly developed total universal venality is more inhuman and more all embracing than the serfdom of the feudal era prostitution is more immoral and more bestial than the jus primae noctis"
"The Christian world order can not be taken any further than this it must collapse under its own weight and make way for a humane rational order"
"The Christian state is merely the last possible manifestation of the state as such its demise will necessarily mean the demise of the state as such"
"The disintegration of mankind into a mass of isolated mutually repelling atoms in itself means the destruction of all corporate national and indeed of any particular interests and is the last necessary step towards the free and spontaneous association of men"
"The supremacy of money as the culmination of the process of alienation is an inevitable stage which has to be passed through if man is to return to himself as he is now on the verge of doing"
"These consequences of the abolition of the feudal system have been taken to such lengths by the social revolution in England that the crisis which will destroy the Christian world order can no longer be far away and indeed that the time of this crisis can be predicted with certainty even if not quantitatively in years at least qualitatively for this crisis must begin when the Corn Laws are repealed and the People ’s Charter introduced 203 in other words when the aristocracy of birth has been politically overcome by the money aristocracy and the latter in turn by working class democracy"
"The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had brought into being all the preconditions for social revolution they had destroyed the Middle Ages established social political and religious Protestantism created England ’s colonies sea power and trade and set up alongside the aristocracy a growing and already quite powerful middle class"
"Social conditions gradually settled down after the disturbances of the seventeenth century and acquired a stable form which they retained until about 1780 or 1790"
"There were at that time three classes of landowners the aristocratical landlords still the only and unchallenged nobility of the kingdom who leased their estates in parcels and consumed the income in London or while travelling the non aristocratical landlords or country gentlemen usually called squires who lived at their country seats put out their land on lease and enjoyed among their tenants and other local inhabitants the aristocratic esteem which was denied to them in the town on account of their humble origin lack of education and unpolished country manners"
"This class has now totally disappeared"
"The old squires who ruled with patriarchal authority the country folk of the district and acted as advisers arbiters and everything rolled into one are quite extinct their descendants call themselves the untitled aristocracy of England as regards education and fine manners luxury and aristocratic demeanour they vie with the aristocracy which has little advantage left over them and all they have in common with their rude and unpolished forefathers are their estates"
"The third class of landowners was that of the yeomen who owned small plots of land which they worked themselves usually in the good old careless manner of their forebears this class too has disappeared from the face of England the social revolution has expropriated it and brought about the curious situation that at the same time as in France the large landed estates were being forcibly parcelled out in England the parcels were being attracted by the large landed estates and swallowed up by them"
"Alongside the yeomen there were small tenant farmers who were usually engaged in weaving as well as farming they too are no longer to be found in modern England almost all the land belongs now to a small number of large estates and is thus let on lease"
"The competition of the large tenant farmers drove the small tenant farmers and yeomen out of the market and impoverished them they became agricultural day labourers and weavers dependent on wages and supplied the masses whose influx caused the towns to grow with such amazing rapidity"
"The farmers of those days led a quiet and placid life of godliness and propriety they lived with few cares but also without any changes without general interests without culture and mental activity they were still at the prehistoric stage"
"The position in the towns was not very different"
"Only London was an important centre of trade Liverpool Hull Bristol Manchester Birmingham Leeds and Glasgow were still insignificant"
"The main industries spinning and weaving were carried on chiefly in the country or at least not within the towns but in their vicinity the production of metal and pottery wares was still at the handicraft stage of development not much was therefore likely to happen in the towns"
"The extreme simplicity of the electoral system relieved the townsfolk of any political cares they were nominally Whig or Tory but knew very well that it really made no difference for they did not have the vote small merchants shopkeepers and craftsmen made up the whole urban population and led that familiar life of the small provincial town which is so totally incomprehensible to the English today"
"Little use was as yet made of the mines iron copper and tin lay more or less undisturbed below ground and coal was only used for domestic purposes"
"In short the situation in England was then similar to that which alas still exists in most of France and particularly in Germany that is a state of antediluvian apathy towards all general and intellectual interests a state of social infancy in which society does not as yet exist where there is as yet"
"no life no consciousness no activity"
"This state is in fact a continuation of feudalism and of medieval thoughtlessness and will only be overcome with the arrival of modern feudalism with the division of society into owners of property and non owners"
"We on the Continent as we have said are still deeply immersed in this state the English fought against it for eighty years and overcame it forty years ago"
"If civilisation is a matter of practice a social quality then the English are indeed the most civilised people in the world"
"I mentioned above that the sciences had assumed their scientific form in the eighteenth century and were consequently connected on the one hand with philosophy and on the other with practice"
"The result of taking philosophy as the point of departure was materialism for which Newton was just as much a prerequisite as Locke the Enlightenment and the French political revolution"
"The result of taking practice as the point of departure was the English social revolution"
"In 1760 George III began his reign drove out the Whigs who had held office almost uninterruptedly since the reign of George I but had of course governed in a thoroughly conservative manner and laid the foundation of the Tory monopoly which lasted until 1830"
"The government thereby regained its inner truth in a politically conservative period in England it was quite appropriate that the conservative party should rule"
"In 1763 Dr. James Watt of Greenock began working on the design of the steam engine and completed it in 1768"
"In 1763 Josiah Wedgwood laid the foundations of the English pottery industry by the introduction of scientific principles"
"By his efforts a desolate area of Staffordshire has been turned into an industrial region the Potteries which now employs 60,000 people and has played a very important part in the social and political movement of recent years"
"In 1768 Richard Arkwright a barber from Preston in Lancashire invented the spinning throstle the first spinning machine which was designed from the outset for mechanical power"
"It produced water twist that is yarn used for warps in weaving"
"In 1776 in Bolton Lancashire Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule by combining the mechanical principles applied in the jenny and the throstle"
"that is the weaver ’s weft all three machines are designed for the working up of cotton"
"These inventions stimulated social development"
"Their most immediate consequence was the rise of English industry or more specifically of cotton manufacture in the first instance"
"The jenny had it is true made the production of yarn cheaper and by the expansion of the market that followed from this it had given the first impetus to industry but it left the social aspect the character of the industrial enterprise more or less unaffected"
"It was Arkwright ’s and Crompton ’s machines and Watt ’s steam engine that first set the movement going by creating the factory system"
"Smaller factories driven by horses or water power arose first but were soon displaced by the larger factories driven by water or steam"
"The first steam spinning mill was set up by Watt in Nottinghamshire in 1785 others followed it and soon the new system became general"
"The spread of the steam spinning mill like all the other industrial improvements introduced simultaneously or later proceeded with enormous speed"
"The import of raw cotton which in 1770 was still less than five million pounds a year rose to 54 million pounds 1800 and 360 million pounds 1836"
"Then the steam loom was actually introduced and gave a new impetus to industrial progress all the machines underwent countless small but when taken together very significant improvements and each new improvement encouraged the spread of the industrial system as a whole"
"All branches of the cotton industry were revolutionised printing was immensely improved by the introduction of mechanical aids and simultaneously by the advances made in chemistry by which dyeing and bleaching profited as well"
"Hosiery manufacture too was carried along by this current and since 1809 machines were used to manufacture fine cotton goods tulle lace etc"
"I have not the space here to pursue the progress of cotton manufacture through all the details of its history I can only indicate the outcome and that when compared with the antediluvian cotton industry with its four million pounds of imported cotton with its spinning wheel hand carding and hand loom can not fail to impress"
"In 1833 10,264 million skeins of yarn were spun in Britain their length amounting to over 5,000 million miles and 350 million ells of cotton fabric were printed 1,300 cotton mills were in operation which employed 237,000 spinners and weavers over 9 million spindles 100,000 steam looms and 240,000 hand looms 33,000 hosiery looms and 3,500 bobbinet machines were in operation cotton manufacturing machinery used 33,000 h.p of steam power and 11,000 h.p of water power and one and a half million people lived directly or indirectly from this industry"
"Lancashire derives its subsistence solely and Lanarkshire largely from the spinning and weaving of cotton the subsidiary branches of the cotton industry are chiefly located in Nottinghamshire Derbyshire and Leicestershire"
"The quantity of exported cotton goods has increased eightfold since 1801 the amount consumed in the country itself has increased a great deal more"
"The impetus given to cotton manufacturing was soon communicated to other branches of industry"
"The woollen industry had until then been the most important branch of industry it was now displaced by cotton but instead of declining it also grew"
"Then people began to apply the machines for spinning cotton to wool and this after a few modifications was entirely successful then the wool industry experienced the same rapid growth as we have already observed in the case of cotton manufacture"
"The import of raw wool rose from 7 million pounds 1801 to 42 million pounds 1835 in the latter year 1,300 woollen mills employing 71,300 workers were in operation not counting a host of hand weavers who worked at home and printers dyers bleachers etc etc who also live indirectly from the wool industry"
"This industry is chiefly located in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the west of England especially Somerset Wiltshire etc"
"The linen industry was formerly located chiefly in Ireland"
"The first factories for the processing of flax were built towards the end of the last century in Scotland"
"The machinery was however still very far from perfect the material gave rise to difficulties which necessitated significant modifications in the machines"
"They were first improved by the Frenchman Girard 1810 but these improvements acquired practical importance first of all in England"
"The introduction of steam looms into the linen industry took place even later and from this point on linen manufacture expanded at immense speed although it suffered from the competition of cotton"
"In England Leeds became the centre of the linen industry in Scotland Dundee and in Ireland Belfast"
"Dundee alone imported 3,000 tons of flax in 1814 and 19,000 tons in 1834"
"The export of linen from Ireland where hand weaving continued to exist alongside power weaving rose by 20 million yards from 1800 to 1825 almost all of which went to England and from there Some of it was re exported"
"Exports from the whole of Britain to foreign countries rose by 27 million yards between 1820 and 1833 in 1835 there were 347 flax mills in operation 170 of these in Scotland 33,000 workers were employed in these mills not counting the many Irish artisans"
"The silk industry only became important after 1824 with the abolition of the heavy customs duties since then the import of raw silk has doubled and the number of factories increased to 266 employing 30,000 workers"
"The centre of ribbon making is Coventry in Warwickshire"
"These four industries which produce yarn and fabrics totally revolutionised"
"Domestic industry was replaced by were thus collective labour in large buildings manual labour was supplanted by steam power and the use of machinery"
"With the aid of the machine a child of eight was now able to produce more than twenty grown men before"
"Six hundred thousand factory workers of whom half are children and more than half female are doing the work of one hundred and fifty million people"
"But that is only the beginning of the industrial revolution"
"We have seen that dyeing printing and bleaching expanded as a result of the advance in spinning and weaving and consequently sought the assistance of engineering and chemistry"
"Since the application of the steam engine and of metal cylinders in printing one man does the work of two hundred the use of chlorine instead of oxygen in bleaching has reduced the time required for this operation from a few months to a few hours"
"While the industrial revolution thus affected the processes to which the product was subjected after spinning and weaving its repercussions on the materials used by the new industry were even more significant"
"It was only through the steam engine that the inexhaustible coal fields beneath the surface of England acquired their great importance new coal mines were opened in large numbers and the old ones worked with redoubled energy"
"The machines were made by machines and by a division of labour extending to the minutest detail it was possible to achieve the precision and exactitude which distinguish English machines"
"The machine building industry in its turn influenced iron and copper mining which however received their chief impetus from another direction but this too was caused by the original revolution effected by Watt and Arkwright"
"The consequences of an industrial impetus once given are endless"
"The progress made in one industry is communicated to all the others"
"The newly created forces demand nourishment as we have just seen the newly created working population brings in its wake new conditions of life and new needs"
"The mechanical advantages of factory production reduce the price of manufactured articles and therefore make the necessities of life and in consequence wages in general cheaper all other products can be sold more cheaply and thereby reach a wider market in proportion to their cheapness"
"Once the advantageous application of mechanical devices has been demonstrated it is gradually imitated throughout industry the advance in civilisation which is the inevitable consequence of all industrial improvements generates new needs new industries and thus again new improvements"
"The consequence of the revolution in cotton spinning was necessarily a revolution in the whole of industry and if we can not always trace how the motive forces are imparted to the more remote branches of the industrial system only the absence of statistical and historical information is to blame"
"But we shall see everywhere that the introduction of mechanical devices and of scientific principles in general has been the mainspring of progress"
"It is chiefly located in Warwickshire Birmingham and Staffordshire Wolverhampton"
"Steam power was very soon employed in this industry and this together with division of labour cut the production costs of metal goods by three quarters"
"On the other hand exports multiplied fourfold from 1800 to 1835"
"In the former year 86,000 cwt of iron goods and the same quantity of copper goods were exported in the latter year 320,000 cwt"
"of iron and 210,000 cwt"
"The export of bar iron and pig iron became significant at the same time in 1800 4,600 tons of bar iron were exported in 1835 92,000 tons of bar iron and 14,000 tons of pig iron"
"The use of steam power especially for grinding and polishing blades the conversion of iron into steel which only then became important and the newly invented method of casting steel brought about a complete revolution here too"
"Sheffield alone consumes annually 500,000 tons of coal and 12,000 tons of iron of which 10,000 tons come from abroad particularly from Sweden"
"The use of cast iron goods also dates from the second half of the last century and has attained its present importance only in the last few years"
"Gas lighting introduced in effect since 1804 created an enormous demand for cast iron pipes the railways suspension bridges etc machinery etc increased this demand still more"
"In 1780 puddling was invented that is the conversion of cast into wrought iron by heating and removing the carbon and this gave new importance to the English iron ore mines"
"For lack of charcoal the English had until then to obtain all their wrought iron from abroad"
"Since 1790 nails have been made by machine and screws since 1810 in Sheffield Huntsman invented crucible steel making in 1760 wire was drawn by machinery and generally a host of new machines was introduced throughout the iron and brass industry manual labour was ousted and insofar as the nature of the business permitted the factory system was established"
"The increase in mining was only the necessary consequence of this"
"Until 1788 all iron ore had been smelted with charcoal and iron extraction had therefore been limited by the small quantity of fuel available"
"After 1788 coke coked coal began to be used instead of charcoal and the amount produced annually was as a result multiplied by six in six years"
"In 1740 the annual output was 17,000 tons in 1835 553,000 tons"
"Extraction from the tin and copper mines has trebled since 1770"
"The growth of coal production since the middle of the last century can not be assessed"
"The vast quantity of coal which is now consumed by the countless steam engines working in the factories and mines by the forges by the smelting furnaces and casting works and by the domestic heating of a population that has doubled bears no relation whatever to the amount consumed one hundred or eighty years ago"
"The most immediate consequence of the creation of industry was the improvement of the means of communication"
"In the last century the roads in England were just as bad as elsewhere and remained so until the celebrated McAdam based road building on scientific principles and thereby gave a new impetus to the advance of civilisation"
"From 1818 to 1829 new highways with a total length of 1,000 English miles were laid down in England and Wales not counting smaller country lanes and almost all the old roads were reconstructed according to McAdam ’s principles"
"In Scotland the public works authorities have built over 1,000 bridges since 1803"
"In Ireland the wide desolate bogs of the south inhabited by half wild robbers were traversed by roads"
"By these means the remotest localities in the country which had previously had no contact with the outside world were now made accessible in particular the Celtic speaking areas of Wales the Scottish Highlands and the south of Ireland were thereby compelled to make acquaintance with the outside world and accept the civilisation imposed upon them"
"In 1755 the first canal of any note was constructed in Lancashire in 1759 the Duke of Bridgewater started to build a canal from Worsley to Manchester"
"Since then canals have been constructed to a total length of 2,200 miles in addition England has another 1,800 miles of navigable rivers which for the most part have also been opened up only recently"
"Since 1807 steam power has been used for the propulsion of ships and since the construction of the first British steamship 1811 600 others have been built"
"In 1835 there were some 550 steamships sailing from British ports"
"The first public railway was built in Surrey in 1801 but only with the opening of the Liverpool Manchester railway 1830 did the new form of transport become important"
"Six years later 680 miles of railway had been constructed and four major lines from London to Birmingham Bristol and Southampton and from Birmingham to Manchester and Liverpool were in operation"
"Since then the network has been extended over the whole of England London is the junction of nine railways and Manchester of five"
"The above statistical data are mainly drawn from The Progress of the Nation by G. Porter a Board of Trade official under the Whig Ministry that is from official sources.-Note by Engels"
"This revolution through which British industry has passed is the foundation of every aspect of modern English life the driving force behind all social development"
"Self interest seized the newly created industrial powers and exploited them for its own purposes these powers which by right belong to mankind became owing to the influence of private property the monopoly of a few rich capitalists and the means to the enslavement of the masses"
"Commerce absorbed industry into itself and thereby became omnipotent it became the nexus of mankind all personal and national intercourse was reduced to commercial intercourse and which amounts to the same thing property things became master of the world"
"The domination of property was bound to turn first against the state and to destroy it or at least as it can not do without it to undermine it"
"Adam Smith began this undermining at the very time of the industrial revolution by publishing in 1776 his Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations and thereby created the science of finance"
"Up to now all finance had been entirely national the economy had been regarded as a mere branch of affairs of the state as a whole and subordinated to the state as such Adam Smith subordinated cosmopolitanism to national aims and raised the economy of the state to the very essence and purpose of the state"
"He reduced politics parties religion indeed everything to economic categories and thereby recognised property as the essence of the state and enrichment as its purpose"
"On the other hand William Godwin An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice 1793 Supported the republican political system propounded at the same time as J. Bentham the principle of utility whereby the republican salts publica supreme lex The public good is the supreme law was taken to its legitimate conclusions and attacked the very essence of the state itself with his aphorism that the state is an evil"
"Godwin still defines the principle of utility quite generally as the duty of the citizen to live only for the general good without regard to his individual interest Bentham on the contrary takes the essentially social nature of this principle further and in accordance with the national trend of that time makes the individual interest the basis of the general interest he recognises that the two are identical in the proposition which his pupil Mill in particular developed that charity is nothing but enlightened egoism and he substitutes the greatest happiness of the greatest number for the general good"
"Bentham here makes the same error in his empiricism as Hegel made in his theory he does not seriously try to overcome the contradictions he turns the subject into the predicate subordinates the whole to the part and in so doing stands everything on its head"
"First he says that the general and individual interests are inseparable and then he stays unilaterally at the crudest individual interest"
"His proposition is only the empirical expression of another one namely that man is mankind but because it is expressed empirically it grants the rights of the species not to the free self conscious creative man but to the crude and blind man who remains within the confines of the contradictions"
"Bentham makes free competition the essence of morality regulates human relations according to the laws of property of things according to the laws of nature and thus represents the culmination of the old naturally evolved Christian world order the highest point of alienation and not the beginning of a new order to be created by self conscious man in full freedom"
"He does not advance beyond the state but strips it of all meaning substitutes social principles for political ones turns the political organisation into the form of the social content and thus carries the contradiction to its extreme limit"
"The democratic party originated at the same time as the industrial revolution"
"In 1769 J. Horne Tooke founded the Society of the Bill of rights in which for the first time since the republic of 1649 60 democratic principles were discussed again"
"As in France the democrats were exclusively men with a philosophical education but they soon found that the upper and middle classes were opposed to them and only the working class lent a ready ear to their principles"
"Amongst the latter class they soon founded a party which by 1794 was already fairly strong 205 and yet still only strong enough to act by fits and starts"
"From 1797 to 1816 it disappeared from view in the turbulent years from 1816 to 1823 it was again very active but then subsided once more into inactivity until the July revolution"
"From then on it has maintained its importance alongside the old parties and is making steady progress as we shall later see"
"The most important effect of the eighteenth century for England was the creation of the proletariat by the industrial revolution"
"The new industry demanded a constantly available mass of workers for the countless new branches of production and moreover workers such as had previously not existed"
"Up to 1780 England had few proletarians a fact which emerges inevitably from the social condition of the nation as described above"
"Industry concentrated work in factories and towns it became impossible to combine manufacturing and agricultural activity and the new working class was reduced to complete dependence on its labour"
"What had hitherto been the exception became the rule and spread gradually outside the towns too"
"Small scale farming was ousted by the large tenant farmers and thus a new class of agricultural labourers was created"
"The population of the towns trebled and quadrupled and almost the whole of this increase consisted solely of workers"
"The expansion of mining likewise required a large number of new workers and these too lived solely from their daily wage"
"On the other hand the middle class rose to become definitely aristocratic"
"During the industrial advance manufacturers multiplied their capital in an amazingly rapid fashion the merchants likewise received their share and the capital created by this revolution was the means by which the English aristocracy fought the French Revolution"
"The result of this whole development was that England is now split into three parties the landed aristocracy the monied aristocracy and working class democracy"
"These are the only parties in England they alone act as driving forces and how they act we will perhaps try to describe in a later article"

"In the previous article we elaborated the criteria for assessing the present position of the British Empire in the history of civilisation and gave the relevant facts concerning the development of the English nation insofar as they are indispensable to this purpose but are little known on the Continent having thus justified our initial assumptions we can now proceed without more ado to the object of our investigation"
"The position of England has hitherto seemed enviable to all other nations of Europe and indeed so it is to anyone who dwells on the surface and observes simply with the eyes of a politician"
"Britain is an empire of such a kind as is possible today and such as all other empires in essence were as well for the empires of Alexander and Caesar too represented like the British the rule of civilised nations over barbarians and colonies"
"No other country in the world can measure up to England in terms of power and wealth and this power and wealth do not lie in the hands of a single despot as was the case in Rome but belong to the educated part of the nation"
"the educated Englishman consequently has about him a degree of innate independence such as no Frenchman to say nothing of German can boast of"
"The political activity the free press the maritime supremacy and the colossal industry of England have so fully developed the energy inherent in the national character the combination of the most resolute force and the calmest deliberation in almost every individual that in this respect too the continental nations trail infinitely far behind the English"
"The history of the British Army and Navy is a series of brilliant victories whilst England has scarcely seen an enemy on its shores for the past eight hundred years the stature of its literature can only be rivalled by the literature of ancient Greece and Germany England has produced at least two great names Bacon and Locke in philosophy and innumerable ones in the empirical sciences and if it is a question of which nation has done most no one can deny that the English are that nation"
"These are the things of which England can be proud in which she surpasses the Germans and the French and which I have listed here at the outset so that the good Germans may convince themselves of my impartiality at the very start for I know full"
"well that in Germany it is much more acceptable to make inconsiderate statements about the Germans than about any other nation"
"And broadly speaking the things I have just listed form the subject matter of that whole literature so voluminous and yet so very unproductive and unnecessary which has been churned out about England on the Continent"
"m Jahre 1835 is still as far as I know held to be the best on the subject in Germany"
"Since England has hitherto only been considered from the political angle let us begin with that"
"Let us examine the English Constitution which as the Tories put it is the most perfect product of English reason and let us as another favour to the politician for the present proceed quite empirically"
"The juste milieu esteem it a particular beauty of the English Constitution that it has developed historically that means in plain German that the old basis created by the revolution of 1688 has been preserved and"
"this foundation as they call it further built on"
"We shall soon see what characteristics the English Constitution has acquired in consequence for the moment a simple comparison of the Englishman of f688 with the Englishman of 1844 will suffice to prove that an identical constitutional foundation for both of them is an absurdity and an impossibility"
"Even disregarding the general progress of civilisation the political character of the nation alone is quite different from what it was then"
"The Test Act the Habeas Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights were Whig measures which arose from the weakness and defeat of the Tories at that time and were directed against these Tories in other words against absolute monarchy and open or concealed Catholicism"
"But within the next fifty years the old Tories disappeared and their descendants adopted the principles which were hitherto the property of the Whigs since George I ascended the throne the monarchical Catholic Tories have become an aristocratic High Church party and since the French Revolution which first woke them up the positive precepts of Toryism have evaporated increasingly into abstract conservatism the undisguised unthinking defence of the status quo indeed even this stage has already been left behind"
"Through Sir Robert Peel Toryism has decided to acknowledge change it has realised that it the English Constitution can not be defended and is making concessions simply to maintain that tottering structure as long as possible"
"Now the inevitable consequence of this historical development is that the inner contradictions which are characteristic features of constitutional monarchy and which were sufficiently exposed even at the time when modern German philosophy still upheld a republican viewpoint that these contradictions attain their most extreme form in the modern English monarchy"
"In fact the English constitutional monarchy is the culmination of constitutional monarchy as such it is the only state where insofar as this is still possible at the present time a real aristocracy of birth has held its position alongside a comparatively highly developed public consciousness and consequently where that trinity of legislative power really exists which on the Continent has been artificially restored and is maintained only with difficulty"
"If the essence of the state as of religion is mankind ’s fear of itself this fear reaches its highest pitch in constitutional and particularly in the English monarchy"
"The experience of three millennia has not made men wiser but on the contrary more confused and more prejudiced it has made them mad and the result of this madness is the political condition of present day Europe"
"The pure monarchy arouses terror people think of Oriental and Roman despotism"
"Pure aristocracy is no less frightening the patricians of Rome and the feudalism of the Middle Ages the nobility of Venice and Genoa have not been in vain"
"Democracy is more dreadful than either Marius and Sulla Cromwell and Robespierre the bloody heads of two kings proscription lists and dictatorship speak loudly enough of the horrors of democracy"
"What then was to be done"
"Instead of proceeding on a straight course instead of concluding from the imperfection or rather inhumanity of all forms of the state that the state itself is the cause of all these inhumanities and is itself inhuman instead of that people took comfort in the view that immorality only adheres to particular forms of the state they deduced from the above premises that the result of three immoral factors can be a moral product and created the constitutional monarchy"
"The first axiom of constitutional monarchy is that of the balance of powers and this axiom is the most perfect expression of mankind ’s fear of itself"
"It is not my intention to comment on the absurd irrationality and total impracticability of this axiom I will merely examine whether it is applied in the English Constitution as I promised I shall stick exclusively to empirical facts so much so indeed that it will perhaps be too much even for our political empiricists"
"I shall therefore not take the English Constitution as it figures in Blackstone ’s Commentaries W. Blackstone Commentaries on the Laws and Constitution of England in de Lolme ’s fantasies J. L. Delolme La Constitution de l'Angleterre or in the long series of constituent statutes from Magna Carta to the Reform Bill but as it is in reality"
"First the monarchic element"
"Everyone knows the real significance of the sovereign king of England whether male or female"
"The power of the Crown is reduced in practice to nil and if this situation notorious the world over needed any further proof the fact that the whole struggle against the Crown ceased over a hundred years ago and that even the radical democratic Chartists know their time is better spent on other things than on this struggle should be sufficient proof"
"Nevertheless and in this fear reaches its climax the English Constitution can not exist without the monarchy"
"Remove the Crown the subjective apex and the whole artificial structure comes tumbling down"
"The English Constitution is an inverted pyramid the apex is at the same time the base"
"And the less important the monarchic element became in reality the more important did it become for the Englishman"
"Nowhere as we all know is a non ruling personage more revered than in England"
"But this loathsome cult of the king as such the veneration of an empty idea or rather not an idea but the word king stripped of all content is the culmination of monarchy just as the veneration of the mere word God is the culmination of religion"
"Then the aristocratic element"
"At least in the sphere assigned to it by the Constitution it fares little better than the Crown"
"But the weaker the Upper House was the firmer was its position in public opinion"
"The constitutional parties the Tories Whigs and Radicals shrink with equal horror from the idea of abolishing this empty formality and the Radicals go no further than to observe that the Lords as the only power in the Constitution that is answerable to no one are an anomaly and that therefore the hereditary peerage should be replaced by an elected peerage"
"Once more it is the fear of humanity which maintains this empty form and the Radicals who are demanding a purely democratic basis for the House of Commons take this fear even further than the other two parties by attempting to breathe new life into the worn out antiquated House of Lords by an infusion of popular blood so as to avoid abandoning it altogether"
"The Chartists have a better idea of what they must do they know that before the assault of a democratic House of Commons the whole rotten structure Crown Lords and so forth must collapse of its own accord and unlike the Radicals they therefore do not worry about the reform of the peerage"
"And just as the veneration for the Crown has grown in proportion as the power of the Crown diminished so the aristocracy has risen all the higher in popular esteem the more the political influence of the House of Lords declined"
"It is not just that the most humiliating formalities of the feudal era have been retained that the members of the House of Commons when they appear in an official capacity before the Lords have to stand cap in hand before the seated and behatted Lords and that the official mode of addressing a nobleman is may it please your lordship etc the worst of it is that all these formalities really are the expression of public opinion which regards a Lord as a being of a superior kind and harbours a respect for pedigrees sonorous titles old family mementoes etc which is as repugnant and nauseating to us continentals as the cult of the Crown"
"In this aspect of the English character too we have again the same veneration for an empty meaningless word"
"the utterly insane fixed idea that a great nation that the human race and the universe could not exist without the word aristocracy"
"For all that the aristocracy nevertheless has an important influence in reality but just as the power of the Crown is the power of the Ministers in other words of the representatives of the majority of the House of Commons and has thus taken quite a different turn from that intended by the Constitution so the power of the aristocracy consists in something quite other than its right to an hereditary seat in the legislature"
"The aristocracy is strong because of its vast estates its wealth in general and it therefore shares this strength with all other non aristocratic men of wealth the power of the Lords is effective not in the House of Lords but in the House of Commons and this brings us to that component of the legislature which according to the Constitution is supposed to represent the democratic element"
"If the Crown and the House of Lords are powerless it follows that all power must necessarily be concentrated in the House of Commons and this is the case"
"The House of Commons being thus omnipotent England ought to be a pure democracy even if nominally the other two branches of the legislature continue to exist provided the democratic element itself were truly democratic"
"The local organisations were quite unaffected by the constitutional settlement after the revolution of 1688 the cities boroughs and constituencies which had previously had the right to send a member retained it and this right was by no means one of the democratic universal human rights but an entirely feudal privilege which as late as Elizabeth ’s reign was conferred quite arbitrarily by the grace and favour of the Crown on many towns which had not previously been represented"
"Even the representative character which the elections to the House of Commons at least originally had was soon lost through historical development"
"The composition of the old House of Commons is well known"
"In the towns the return of a member was either in the hands of an individual or of an exclusive corporation co opting its own members only a few boroughs were open in other words had a fairly large electorate and here the most brazen bribery put paid to the last vestiges of true representation"
"The closed boroughs were mostly in the pocket of one individual usually a lord and in the rural constituencies the all powerful big landowners suppressed any free spontaneous stirring there might be among the people who were moreover politically inert"
"The old House of Commons was no more than an exclusive medieval corporation independent of the people the culmination of the historical right incapable of adducing even a single genuinely or apparently rational argument for its existence existing in defiance of all reason and hence denying in 1794 through its committee that it was an assembly of representatives and that England was a representative state"
"Second Report of the Committee of Secrecy to whom the Papers referred to in His Majesty ’s Message on the 12 May 1794 were delivered Report on the London Revolutionary Societies London 1794"
"In comparison with such a Constitution the theory of representative government even of an ordinary constitutional monarchy with a chamber of deputies must have appeared thoroughly revolutionary and reprehensible and the Tories were therefore quite right when they described the Reform Bill as a measure diametrically opposed to the spirit and the letter of the Constitution and which undermined the Constitution"
"The Reform Bill however went through and it is now our task to see what it has made of the English Constitution and particularly of the House of Commons"
"In the first place the conditions for the election of members in the countryside have remained exactly the same"
"The electors are here almost exclusively tenant farmers and they are utterly dependent on their landlord since the latter who has no contractual relationship with them may at any time terminate the lease"
"The members for the counties as opposed to the towns remain as they were before deputies of the landowners since it is only at times of the greatest unrest as in 1831 209 that the tenant farmers dare to vote against the landowners"
"Indeed the Reform Bill only aggravated the evil since it increased the number of county members"
"Of the 252 county members the Tories can consequently always count on at least 200 except when there is general unrest among the tenant farmers which would make any intervention by the landowners unwise"
"In the towns representation was introduced at least formally and every man occupying a house of at least ten pounds sterling annual rental value and paying direct taxes poor rate etc received the vote"
"By this means the enormous majority of the working classes is excluded for in the first place it is naturally only the married who live in separate houses and"
"even if a significant number of these houses have an annual rent of ten pounds almost all the occupiers avoid the payment of direct taxes and are therefore not electors"
"Universal suffrage as advocated by the Chartists would at least treble the number of persons entitled to vote"
"The towns are thus in the hands of the middle class and this in its turn is in the smaller towns very frequently directly or indirectly dependent on the landlords via the tenant farmers who are the main customers of the tradesmen and craftsmen"
"Only in the large towns does the middle class really achieve supremacy and in the smaller factory towns especially in Lancashire where the middle class lacks significant numbers and the country people significant influence where therefore even a minority of the working class has a decisive effect on the outcome the illusory representation approaches true representation in some measure"
"These towns e.g. Ashton Oldham Rochdale Bolton etc consequently send almost exclusively Radicals to Parliament"
"Apart from these various and in practice very complex influences various local interests also make themselves felt and finally a very significant influence bribery"
"In the first article of the present series we already mentioned that the House of Commons through its Bribery Committee declared that it was elected by bribery and Thomas Duncombe the only thoroughgoing Chartist member long ago told the House of Commons plainly that not a single member of the whole assembly not even he himself could say that he had secured his seat by the free vote of his constituents without bribery"
"Last summer Richard Cobden member for Stockport and leader of the Anti Corn Law League declared at a public meeting in Manchester that bribery had reached greater proportions than ever that in the Tory Carlton Club and the Liberal Reform Club in London the representation of towns was positively auctioned to the highest bidder and that these clubs acted as contractors for so many pounds we guarantee you a certain position etc"
"And on top of all this we must not forget the fine manner in which the elections are held the general drunkenness amid which the votes are cast the public houses where the electors become intoxicated at the candidates expense the disorder the brawling the howling of the crowds at the voting booths thus putting the finishing touches to the hollowness of representation which is valid for seven years"
"We have seen that the Crown and the House of Lords have lost their importance we have seen how the all powerful House of Commons is recruited the question is now who then actually rules in England"
"Property enables the aristocracy to control the election of deputies for rural areas and small towns property enables the merchants and manufacturers to choose the members for the large and to some extent also for the small towns property enables both to increase their influence by bribery"
"The rule of property is explicitly recognised in the Reform Bill by the property qualification incorporated in it"
"And to the extent that property and the influence conferred by property constitute the essence of the middle class to the extent therefore that the aristocracy brings its property to bear in the elections and thus does not act as an aristocracy but puts itself on a level with the middle class to the extent that the influence of the actual middle class is on the whole much greater than that of the aristocracy to that extent the middle class does indeed rule"
"But how and why does it rule"
"England is admittedly a democracy but in the same way as Russia is a democracy as the people unwittingly rules everywhere and the government in every state is but another expression for the level of education of the people"
"It will be difficult to retrace our steps from the practice of the English Constitution to the theory of it"
"There is the most flagrant contradiction between the theory and the practice the two are so estranged from one another that they no longer have any similarity"
"On the one hand the trinity of the legislature on the other the tyranny of the middle class on the one hand a two chamber system on the other the all powerful House of Commons on the one hand the royal prerogative on the other a government chosen by the Commons on the one hand an independent House of Lords with hereditary legislators on the other a home for antiquated members of the Commons"
"Each of the three components of the legislature has had to surrender its power to another element the Crown to the Ministers in other words to the majority of the House of Commons the Lords to the Tory party that is to a popular element and to the Ministers who create the peers in other words basically to a popular element too and the Commons to the middle class or which amounts to the same thing to the people that has not yet come of age politically"
"In reality the English Constitution has ceased to exist at all the whole wearisome process of legislation is a mere farce the contradiction between theory and practice has become so glaring that it can not possibly persist for long and even if the vitality of this ailing Constitution appears to have been somewhat increased by the emancipation of the Catholics 211 of which we shall have cause to speak further and by the parliamentary and municipal reform these measures which in themselves are an admission that hope of preserving the Constitution has been given up introduce into it elements which unquestionably contradict the fundamental principles of the Constitution and thus further intensify the conflict by making the theory contradict itself"
"We have seen that the organisation of powers in the English Constitution depends entirely on fear"
"This fear is even more evident in the rules by which legislation proceeds the so called Standing Orders"
"Every Bill must pass three readings in each of the two Houses at stated intervals after the second reading it is referred to a Committee which discusses it in detail in cases of some importance the House becomes a Committee of the whole House to discuss the Bill and appoints a reporter who afterwards with great solemnity presents a report on"
"the discussion to the very House that discussed the Bill"
"Incidentally is this not the most splendid example of the transcendent within the immanent and the immanent within the transcendent that a Hegelian could possibly wish for"
"The knowledge the House of Commons has of the committee is the knowledge the committee has of itself and the reporter is the absolute personification of the intermediary in whom the two are identical"
"Every Bill is thus discussed eight times before it can receive the royal assent"
"They realise that progress is the essence of humanity but have not the courage to proclaim progress openly they pass laws which are supposed to have absolute validity and which therefore put barriers in the way of progress and by reserving the right to amend laws the progress which they have just denied is allowed in again through the backdoor"
"But care must be taken not to proceed too fast not to be over hasty"
"Progress is revolutionary it is dangerous and there must therefore be a powerful brake on it before they decide to acknowledge it they must ponder the matter eight times"
"Instead of ensuring a comprehensive examination of the Bills the repeated reading of them becomes quite superfluous in practice and a mere formality"
"The main argument is usually concentrated in the first or second reading sometimes also in the debates in committee according to what suits the opposition best"
"The whole futility of this multiplication of debates becomes evident when one considers that the fate of each Bill is already decided at the outset and where it is not decided the debate concerns not the particular Bill but the existence of a Cabinet"
"The outcome of all these antics which are repeated eight times is thus not a calmer discussion in the House itself but something quite different which was by no means the intention of those who introduced these antics"
"The protracted nature of the deliberations gives public opinion time to form an opinion about the proposed measure and if need be to oppose it by means of meetings and petitions and often as last year in the case of Sir James Graham ’s Education Bill successfully"
"But this as we have said was not the original purpose and could be achieved far more simply"
"While we are now on the subject of the Standing Orders we may mention a few more points which betray the fear that is part of the English Constitution and the original corporate character of the House of Commons"
"The debates in the House of Commons are not public admission is a privilege and is usually secured only by written order of a member"
"During divisions the galleries are cleared despite this absurd secretiveness the abolition of which the House has always vigorously opposed the names of the members who have voted for and against are in all the newspapers on the following day"
"These and a host of other points in the Standing Orders show the exclusive anti popular character of the reformed Parliament and the tenacity with which the House of Commons holds to these customs shows clearly enough that it has no desire to transform itself from a privileged corporative body into an assembly of representatives of the people"
"Another proof of this is the privilege enjoyed by Parliament the exceptional position of its members vis-"
"-vis the courts and the right of the House of Commons to have anyone it wishes arrested"
"Originally aimed against infringements by the Crown which has since that time been deprived of all its power this privilege has in recent times only been used against the people"
"In 1771 the House was angered by the insolence of the newspapers which had published its debates a thing which after all only the House itself was entitled to do and tried to put a stop to this insolence by arresting the printers and then the officials who had released these printers"
"Of course this was unsuccessful but the attempt shows the nature of the privileges Parliament enjoys and its failure shows that even the House of Commons despite its being exalted over the people is nevertheless dependent on the latter in other words that the House of Commons does not rule either"
"In a country where Christianity is part and parcel of the laws of the land the Established Church is necessarily part of the Constitution"
"According to her Constitution England is essentially a Christian state indeed a fully developed and powerful Christian state state and church merge entirely with one another and are inseparable"
"This unity of church and state can however only exist in one Christian denomination to the exclusion of all others and these excluded sects are of course thereby branded as heretical and are victims of religious and political persecution"
"So it is in England"
"These sects were thus all along thrown together as one class excluded as nonconformists or dissenters from all participation in the state harassed and hampered in their worship and prosecuted by penal laws The more fervently they declared themselves against the unity of church and state the more violently was this unity defended by the ruling party and exalted to a vital concern of the state"
"When the Christian state in England was still in its heyday the persecution of the dissenters and more especially of the Catholics was therefore a daily occurrence a persecution which was admittedly less violent but more universal and persistent than that of the Middle Ages"
"The disease ceased to be acute and became chronic the sudden blood thirsty outbursts of anti Catholic fury were transformed into cold political calculation which sought to exterminate heterodoxy by gentler but sustained pressure"
"Persecution was transferred to the secular sphere and thereby made harder to bear"
"Disbelief in the Thirty Nine Articles 213 ceased to be blasphemy instead it was made a crime against the state"
"But the progress of history was not to be halted the discrepancy between the legislation of 1688 and public opinion as it existed in 1828 was so great that in the latter year even the House of Commons found itself obliged to revoke the most oppressive laws against the dissenters"
"The Test Act and the religious clauses of the Corporation Act 214 were abolished the emancipation of the Catholics 215 followed in the next year despite the furious opposition of the Tories"
"The Tories the exponents of the Constitution were perfectly correct in their opposition as not one of the liberal parties not even the Radicals attacked the Constitution itself"
"The Constitution was to remain the foundation for them too and on the basis of the Constitution only the Tories were consistent"
"They realised and said so that the above measures would inevitably bring about the downfall of the Anglican Church and necessarily that of the Constitution too that to give the dissenters the civil rights would mean the de facto destruction of the Anglican Church and the sanctioning of the attacks on the Anglican Church that it is a dangerous inconsistency towards the state itself to allow a Catholic a share in administration and legislation since he recognises the authority of the Pope over the power of the state"
"Their arguments could not be answered by the Liberals nevertheless the emancipation went through and the prophecies of the Tories are already beginning to be fulfilled"
"So in this way the Anglican Church has become an empty name and now only differs from the other denominations by virtue of the three million pounds it draws annually and a few small privileges which are just sufficient to sustain the struggle against it"
"Amongst these are the ecclesiastical courts in which the Anglican bishop exercises sole but quite unimportant jurisdiction and whose oppressiveness consists particularly in the law costs and then there are also the local church rates which are used for the maintenance of the buildings available for the use of the Established Church the dissenters come under the jurisdiction of these courts and are equally liable for payment of these rates"
"But it is not just the legislation against the church but also the legislation for it which has contributed towards making the Established Church an empty name"
"The Church of Ireland has always been a mere name a perfect established or government church a complete hierarchy from the archbishop down to the vicar lacking nothing except a congregation and whose occupation consists in preaching praying and singing off litanies to the empty pews"
"The Church of England has an audience it is true although it too especially in Wales and the factory districts has been to a considerable degree dislodged by the dissenters but then the well paid pastors trouble themselves little about their sheep"
"If you wish to bring a caste of priests into disrepute and cause its downfall then pay it well says Bentham and the English and Irish churches testify to the truth of this statement"
"In the countryside and in the towns of England nothing is more hateful and more contemptible to the people than a Church of England parson"
"And in the case of as pious a people as the English that is really saying something"
"It is self evident that the emptier and more meaningless the name of the Anglican Church becomes the more firmly does the conservative party and indeed the confirmed constitutional party become attached to it the separation of church and state might draw tears even from Lord John Russell it is equally self evident that the emptier the name becomes the harsher and the more strongly felt does its oppressiveness become"
"The Irish Church particularly because it is the most insignificant is the most hated it has no other purpose than to embitter the people than to remind them that they are a subjugated people upon whom the conqueror forces his religion and his institutions"
"Hence England is now at a stage of transition from a determinate to an indeterminate Christian state to a state which bases itself not on one determinate denomination but on an indeterminate Christianity a mean of all existing denominations"
"Naturally the old determinate Christian state defended itself against unbelief and the Apostasy Act of 1699 punishes it with the loss even of the passive civil rights and with imprisonment this Act has never been annulled but is no longer ever applied"
"Another law originating in Elizabeth ’s times lays down that anyone who fails to attend church on Sunday without a proper excuse if I am not mistaken even the episcopal church is laid down because Elizabeth acknowledged no dissenting chapels is to be made to attend it by a fine or imprisonment"
"In the countryside this law is still frequently applied even here in civilised Lancashire a few hours travel from Manchester there are some bigoted justices of the Peace who as Mr. Gibson member for Manchester alleged a fortnight ago in the House of Commons 216 have sentenced a large number of people sometimes to six weeks imprisonment for failing to attend church"
"However the main laws against unbelief are those which disqualify from taking an oath anyone who does not believe in a God or in any reward or punishment in the afterlife and make blasphemy a punishable offence"
"But the indeterminate Christian state too is moving towards its downfall even before it has been officially recognised by legislation"
"The Apostasy Act is as we have said entirely obsolete the requirement of church attendance is likewise rather antiquated and it is only enforced in exceptional cases the blasphemy law is likewise beginning thanks to the fearlessness of the English Socialists and particularly of Richard Carlile to become antiquated and is only applied here and there in particularly bigoted localities such as Edinburgh and even a refusal of the oath is avoided where possible"
"The Christian party has become so weak that it realises itself that a strict operation of these law is would bring about their repeal before long and it therefore prefers to remain passive so that the Damocles sword of Christian legislation may at least remain suspended over the heads of the unbelievers and perhaps continue to be effective as a threat and deterrent"
"Apart from the political institutions proper which we have so far considered there are several other matters which may be included in the sphere of the Constitution"
"There has so far been scarcely any mention of the rights of the citizen within the Constitution strictly speaking the individual has no rights in England"
"These rights exist either through custom or by virtue of individual statutes which are quite unconnected with the Constitution"
"We shall see how this strange separation has arisen for the moment we move on to a critique of these rights"
"The first is the right that any man may publish his opinion without hindrance and without the previous permission of the government the freedom of the press"
"Taken as a whole it is true that nowhere is the freedom of the press more extensive than in England and yet this freedom is still very limited here"
"The law of libel the law of high treason and the law of blasphemy weigh heavily on the press and if the press is rarely prosecuted that is not due to the law but to the government ’s fear of the inevitable unpopularity which would follow measures taken against the press"
"English newspapers of all parties commit press offences every day both against the government and against individuals but they are allowed to pass with impunity until it is possible to launch a political trial and then the occasion is used to deal with the press as well"
"That is how it turned out with the Chartists in 1842 and just recently with the Irish Repealers"
"The freedom of the press in England has been living just as much on grace and favour for the past hundred years as it did in Prussia from 1842"
"The second birthright of the Englishman is the right of popular assembly a right which no other nation in Europe has enjoyed to date"
"This right although very ancient was subsequently made explicit in a statute as the right of the people to assemble for the purpose of discussing grievances and petitioning the legislature for their remedy"
"This wording contains a limitation"
"If no petition results from a meeting the latter thereby acquires if not precisely an illegal character then at least a very ambiguous one"
"In O'Connell ’s trial"
"the Crown particularly emphasised that the meetings which were described as illegal were not convened for the deliberation of petitions"
"The main limitation however is imposed by the police the central or local government can prohibit any meeting in advance or interrupt and dissolve it and it has done this often enough not just at Clontarf but actually in England in the case of Chartist and Socialist meetings.[218"
"This however is not considered an attack on the Englishman ’s birthrights because the Chartists and Socialists are poor devils and thus have no rights no one cares two hoots about it except the Northern Star and the New Moral World and therefore one hears nothing about it on the Continent"
"Then the right of association"
"All associations which pursue lawful aims by lawful means"
"are permitted but in any given case only one big society is allowed and this may not include branch associations"
"The formation of societies divided into local branches each with its own organisation is only permitted for charitable or pecuniary purposes in general and may only be embarked upon in England on the issue of a certificate by an official appointed for this purpose"
"The Socialists obtained such a certificate for their organisation by declaring their purpose was of this nature it was denied to the Chartists although they copied the statutes of the socialist society word for word in their own"
"They are now forced to circumvent the law and are thus put in a position where a single slip of the pen by a single member of the Chartist association[219 may entangle the whole society in the snares of the law"
"But even apart from that the right of association in its full extent is a privilege of the rich an association needs money first of all and it is easier for the rich Anti Corn Law League 220 to raise hundreds of thousands than for the poor Chartist society or the Union of British Miners to meet the bare expenses of association"
"And an association which has no funds at its disposal is not likely to have much effect and can not conduct any agitation"
"The right of Habeas Corpus that is the right of any accused person high treason constitutes an exception to be released on bail pending the start of the trial this much praised right is once more a privilege of the rich"
"The poor man can not offer surety and therefore must go to prison"
"The last of these rights of the individual is the right of each man to be tried only by his peers and that too is a privilege of the rich man"
"The poor man is not tried by his peers he is without exception tried by his born enemies for in England the rich and the poor are openly at war with one another"
"The jury must have certain qualifications and their nature is evident from the fact that the jury list in Dublin a city of 250,000 inhabitants contains only 800 qualified persons"
"At the most recent Chartist trials at Lancaster Warwick and Stafford 221 the workers were tried by landlords and tenant farmers who are mostly Tories and by manufacturers or merchants who are mostly Whigs but in any case they are the enemies of the Chartists and the workers"
"But that is not all"
"When O'Connell was tried four weeks ago in Dublin every member of the jury being a Protestant and Tory was his enemy"
"A Catholic in the jury would have prevented the verdict he would have made any verdict impossible except an acquittal"
"This case is a particularly blatant example but fundamentally it is the same in any case"
"Trial by jury is in essence a political and not a legal institution but because all law is essentially political in origin the reality of legal practice is revealed in it and the English trial by jury because it is the most highly developed is the consummation of juridical mendacity and immorality"
"The starting point is the fiction of the impartial juryman it is impressed upon the jury that they must forget everything relating to the current case that they may have heard before the trial and judge only by the evidence brought before the Court as though such a thing were possible"
"The second fiction is that of the impartial judge whose task is to expound the law and bring together the arguments presented by both sides without partiality quite objectively as though that were possible"
"It is moreover required of the judge that he should especially and in spite of everything exert no influence on the verdict of the jury and should not put the verdict into their mouths in other words he must present the premises as they need to be presented for the conclusion to be drawn but he should not draw the conclusion himself he may not even draw it for himself for that would have an effect on his presentation of the premises all these and a hundred other impossibilities inhumanities and stupidities are demanded simply so as decently to conceal the original stupidity and inhumanity"
"But there is no deceiving actual practice in practice all this rubbish is ignored the judge gives the jury clearly enough to understand what sort of verdict it is to pronounce and that verdict is then regularly brought in by the obedient jury"
"The defendant must be protected in every way the defendant like the king is sacred and inviolable and can do no wrong in other words he can do nothing at all and if he does do anything it has no validity"
"The defendant may confess his crime it will avail him not at all"
"The law decides that he is not trustworthy I believe it was in 1819 that a man arraigned his wife for adultery after she had confessed to her husband during an illness she thought would prove fatal that she had committed adultery but the defence counsel for the wife objected that the defendant ’s confession was no evidence and the charge was dismissed"
"The sanctity of the defendant is furthermore sustained in the legal formalities which surround the English jury and which offer such a very fertile field to the cavilling wiles of the barristers"
"That a trivial technical blunder can upset a whole trial verges on the incredible"
"In 1800 a man was found guilty of forgery but released because his defence counsel discovered before the sentence was pronounced that on the forged banknote the name was written in the abbreviated form Bartw while in the bill of indictment Bartholomew was written in full"
"In 1827 a woman was charged with infanticide in Winchester but acquitted because in the verdict of the coroner ’s jury the latter declared upon their oath The jurors of our Lord the King upon their oath present that etc a that such and such had happened whereas this jury of thirteen men had sworn not one oath but thirteen oaths and the verdict therefore ought to have read upon their oaths”.[Ibid"
"A year ago in Liverpool a boy who stole a handkerchief out of someone ’s pocket one Sunday evening was caught in the act and arrested"
"His father objected that the police officer had arrested him unlawfully because there is a law which says no one may perform on Sunday the work by which he earns his living the police therefore may not arrest anyone on Sunday"
"The judge agreed with this but continued to examine the boy and when the latter confessed he was a thief by profession he was fined five shillings because he had followed his profession on a Sunday"
"English law sanctifies the defendant and is applied against the society for whose protection it really exists"
"As in Sparta it is not the crime but the stupidity with which it is committed that is punished"
"Any form of protection is turned against the person whom it is intended to protect the law is intended to protect society and attacks it it is intended to protect the defendant and injures him for it is obvious that any man who is too poor to oppose the official pettifogging with a counsel equally skilled in pettifogging has against him all the forms which were created for his protection"
"Any man who is too poor to provide a defence counsel or an appropriate number of witnesses has no hope in any suit that is in the least degree doubtful"
"But the culmination of the whole system is the rule that the twelve jurors must be unanimous in their verdict"
"They are locked in a room and are not let out until they are agreed or the judge realises that they can not be brought to unanimity"
"It is however thoroughly inhuman and to such an extent contrary to human nature that it is quite ridiculous to demand that twelve people should be of exactly the same opinion on a particular issue"
"But it is consistent"
"The procedure of the Inquisition is to torture the accused physically or mentally the jury system declares the accused sacred and tortures the witnesses with a cross examination in no way less formidable than that of the Inquisition it even tortures the jury it must have a verdict though the heavens should fall in the process the jury is punished by imprisonment until it produces a verdict and if it should be so capricious as to wish to adhere to its oath a new jury is appointed there is a retrial and so on until either the prosecution or the jury becomes weary of the struggle and surrenders unconditionally"
"Proof enough that the whole legal system can not exist without torture and is in any case barbaric"
"Practice once again brings to light what lies behind all these things in practice the jury takes the easy way out and there being no alternative breaks its oath with perfect composure"
"In 1824 a jury in Oxford could not agree"
"guilty eleven not guilty"
"Finally they reached a settlement the one dissenter wrote guilty on the bill of indictment and withdrew then came the foreman with the other jurors picked up the paper and wrote not in front of the word guilty Wade British History"
"Another case is recounted by Fonblanque editor of the Examiner in his work England under Seven Administrations"
"In this instance too a jury could not reach a decision and eventually the jurors had recourse to the drawing of lots they took two straws and drew the opinion of the party which drew the longer straw was adopted"
"It is well known that the English Penal Code is the most severe in Europe"
"As recently as 1810 it was in no way inferior in barbarity to that of the Carolina 222 burning breaking on the wheel quartering disembowelment while the person was still alive etc were widely used types of punishment"
"Since then it is true the most outrageous atrocities have been abolished but there still remain numerous instances of brutality and infamy unamended on the statute book"
"The death penalty applies to seven crimes murder high treason rape sodomy breaking and entering robbery with violence and arson with intent to kill only in 1837 was the formerly much more widely applicable death penalty limited to this number and in addition English penal law knows two forms of punishment of particularly choice barbarity transportation or debasement through association and solitary confinement or debasement through isolation"
"Neither could be more cruelly or more vilely chosen to ruin systematically and consistently the victims of the law physically intellectually and morally and to reduce them to below the level of beasts"
"The prisoner in solitary confinement is driven insane the model gaol in London after only three months of existence had already three lunatics to transfer to Bedlam to say nothing of the religious mania which is still usually regarded as sanity"
"The penal laws against political crimes are drawn up in almost exactly the same terms as in Prussia particularly exciting discontent and seditious language are phrased in the same vague way which gives so much latitude to the judge and jury"
"In this field too the penalties are harsher than elsewhere transportation is the main form"
"If these severe penalties and these ill defined political crimes are less significant in practice than it might seem according to the law this is on the one hand a failing in the law itself which is so confused and unclear that a clever barrister can raise objections in the defendant ’s favour at every turn"
"gathered over five hundred years which contradict each other and represent not a state of law but a state of complete lawlessness"
"The barrister is everything here anyone who has wasted a lot of his time on this legal jungle on this chaos of contradictions is all powerful in an English law court"
"The uncertainty of the law naturally led to belief in the authority of decisions taken by past judges in similar cases and this only aggravates the uncertainty since these decisions also contradict one another and the outcome of the proceedings depends again on the learning and presence of mind of the barrister"
"On the other hand lack of importance of English penal law is however just a matter of clemency etc and regard for public opinion which the law by no means obliges the government to have and the vigorous opposition to all law reforms shows that the legislature is by"
"But it should never be forgotten that property rules and that in consequence this clemency is only practised towards respectable criminals it is on the poor man on the pariah on the proletarian that the full force of the law ’s barbarity descends and no one cares a brass farthing about it"
"This favouritism towards the rich is moreover explicitly stated in the law"
"One only needs to read the police reports in the first English newspaper that comes to hand to be convinced of the truth of this statement"
"The maltreatment of the poor and the preferential treatment of the rich in all the courts of law is so universal is practised so openly and brazenly and is reported so shamelessly by the newspapers that one can rarely read a paper without being filled with indignation"
"Such a rich man is always treated with uncommon courtesy and however brutal his offence may have been the judges are always very sorry that they have to sentence him to what is usually a quite paltry fine"
"The administration of the law is in this respect still more inhuman than the law itself law grinds the poor and rich men rule the law and there is one law for the poor and another for the rich"
"are completely true sayings that have long since become proverbial"
"But how can it be otherwise"
"The magistrates and the jury alike are themselves rich are chosen from the middle class and are thus biased towards their own kind and are born enemies of the poor"
"And if the social effect of property which we can not go into now is taken into account then indeed nobody can be surprised at such a barbaric state of affairs"
"The question of direct social legislation in which this infamy culminates will be dealt with later"
"In any case it could not be described in its full significance at this point"
"Whatever objections may be raised to it from the viewpoint of the constitutional state are a matter of supreme indifference"
"For us there is only one matter of importance that we have found everywhere theory and practice in flagrant contradiction with each other"
"All the powers of the Constitution the Crown the House of Lords and the House of Commons have dissolved before our eyes we have seen that the Established Church and all the so called birthrights of the British are empty names that even trial by jury is in reality only an outward show that even the law has no existence in short that a state which has given itself a clearly defined legal foundation denies and abuses this foundation"
"We have seen furthermore what a jungle of lies and immorality follows from this state of affairs people prostrate themselves before empty names and deny reality they do not want to know anything about it and are reluctant to acknowledge what really exists what they have themselves created they deceive themselves and invent a language of conventions with artificial concepts each of which is a parody of reality and cling fearfully to these hollow abstractions so as to avoid having to own to themselves that what matters in real life in practice are quite different things"
"The whole English Constitution and the whole of constitutional public opinion is nothing but a big lie which is constantly supported and concealed by a number of small lies whenever at one point or another its true nature appears a little too openly in the light of day"
"And even if a person comes to the realisation that the whole of this construction is but untruth and fiction even then he still adheres to it indeed more tenaciously than ever so that the empty words the few meaninglessly assembled letters should not fall apart for these words are after all the pivot on which the world turns and"
"with them the world and mankind would of necessity plunge into the darkness of chaos"
"One can not but turn away in deep disgust from this tissue of blatant and concealed lies of hypocrisy and self deception"
"Can such a state of affairs last long"
"There is no chance of that"
"The struggle is already on"
"The Constitution is shaken to its foundations"
"What form the immediate future will take emerges from what has just been said"
"The new alien elements in the Constitution are democratic in nature it will become evident that public opinion too is developing in a democratic direction the immediate future of England will be democracy"
"But what a democracy"
"Not that of the French Revolution whose antithesis was the monarchy and feudalism but the democracy whose antithesis is the middle class and property"
"The whole of the preceding development shows this"
"The democracy towards which England is moving is a social democracy"
"But democracy by itself is not capable of curing social ills"
"Democratic equality is a chimera the fight of the poor against the rich can not be fought out on a basis of democracy or indeed of politics as a whole"
"This stage too is thus only a transition the last purely political remedy which has still to be tried and from which a new element is bound to develop at once a principle transcending everything of a political nature"
"This principle is the principle of socialism"

"There were riots at Munich on the 3rd inst"
"on account of a rise in the price of beer"
"The tumult was serious and was not quelled without a somewhat sanguinary use of the soldiery who by express orders of the King"
"The following later particulars show the people have triumphed and the King succumbed the cause being that the royal man slayer feared that his own tools the troops would turn against him"
"Tranquillity has been re established in our town but it can not be denied that the royal authority has suffered a good deal in the transaction"
"The King after having shown himself greatly opposed to any sort of conciliation or compromise after having himself ordered the soldiery to charge the people and that in his own presence ended by requiring of the brewers that they should yield to the popular demands"
"This morning notice was stuck up at the corners of all the streets that the increase in the price of beer would not take place and the people appeared satisfied but they at the same time retain a secret animosity against the King for having ordered them to he fired upon an order which cost the lives of several of the people of this town"
"It appears that the King yielded principally on account of the small degree of devotion shown towards him by the troops who did not appear at all willing to fire upon the people"

"Count Adam Gurowski who took an active part in the revolution of 1830 afterwards deserted his party was allowed to return to his country and became notorious in a very unenviable manner by some publications 227 in which he advised his countrymen to consider the annihilation of their independence as a judgment of God to which they must humbly submit and seek shelter at the throne of the mighty Czar in whose hands God had laid their fates"
"He told them that Poland could not have met with a better luck than it had done by being subdued under the Russian yoke that it was their duty to abandon all hopes of independence and that in fine the Czar ’s government was the very best that could be found on the face of the earth"
"He expected of course to be rewarded by Nicholas but the autocrat was too prudent to trust a traitor"
"He used him and abandoned him he gave him a subordinate office which Gurowski resigned when he saw that he had no hope of being promoted he could not even get the rights of a nation which by his participation in the insurrection were forfeited and at last he has chosen to leave Poland again to take shelter in Prussia and to go to Breslau where he has requested the authorities to be treated as a military deserter"

"The military was called in but a regiment of horse guards when commanded to mount on horseback refused to do so"
"The police being as everywhere obnoxious to the people were severely beaten and ill treated by the rioters and every station formerly occupied by police officers had to be occupied by soldiers who being upon good terms with the people were considered less hostile and showed an evident reluctance to interfere"
"They only did interfere when the palace of the King was attacked and then they merely took up such a position as was sufficient to keep the rioters back"

"The French papers assert that the King on this occasion ordered the military stationed before the theatre to fire upon the people and that the soldiers refused"
"The German papers do not mention this as may be expected from their being published under censorship but as the French papers are sometimes rather ill informed about foreign matters we can not vouch for the truth of their assertion"

"The parsonocracy of this country enjoying the peculiar protection and favour of the present government assume every day a more haughty position"
"It has for instance lately occurred in Berlin that one parson after the other refused to perform marriage ceremonies on a Saturday alleging as his reason for this refusal that the parties would in all probability not rise on Sunday morning in a fit state of mind for the celebration of the Lord ’s day if they were married on the previous day"
"Of course the Berliners who care very little about a due celebration of the Sunday and on the contrary make it the merriest day of the week are crying out that the governing party was going to introduce among them the English Sunday than which they know nothing more formidable"

"The valley of the River Rhone from its source at the foot of the glacier du Rhone to the Lake Leman Lake of Geneva is one of the finest countries in the world"
"On its sides are the highest mountains of Europe two uninterrupted chains of a mean height of 12,000 feet covered with eternal snow from which spring the numberless rivulets which feed the Rhone and fertilise the meadows and fields of the valley"
"Here within a few"
"hours walk from eternal winter the chestnut and the vine are found thriving under a sun as powerful almost in its warmth as that of the evergreen plains of Lombardy"
"The German name for it is Wallis and inhabited partly by Germans partly by Frenchmen"
"The Germans entering the country from the north east occupy the higher and more mountainous part of the valley where the country is unfavourable to agriculture but excellent for the breeding of cattle consequently this part of the population remains up to this time in almost the same state of nature in which their forefathers occupied the Upper Valais"
"Political and religious education is left entirely in the hands of a few aristocratic families and of the priesthood who of course keep the people as stupid and superstitious as possible"
"The French have founded the more considerable towns of the Valais are educated and civilised and by their bordering on the lake and the Radical canton of Vaud 230 are brought into connection with the outer world and enabled to keep up with the progress of their neighbour ’s ideas"
"Nevertheless the rough mountaineers of the Upper Valais had I know not how many hundred years ago subdued the French Lower Valais and continued to consider this part of the country as a conquered province and to exclude its inhabitants from any participation in government"
"In 1798 when the French overthrew the old aristocratic system of Swiss patrician despotism 231 the Lower Valais got its share of government but not to the full extent it was entitled to"
"In 1830 when the democratic party in all Switzerland was in the ascendant the constitution was re modelled upon fair and democratic principles"
"232 but the priest ridden cow herds of Upper Valais and the sovereign rulers of their minds the parsons have ever since tried to bring about a change in favour of the old system of injustice"
"The Radical party in order to guard against this formed an association called Young Switzerland la jeune Suisse among themselves and the Radicals of Vaud"
"They were most violently assailed and calumniated by the priesthood and usually attacked upon the ground of being infidels which however on the continent is a charge more laughed at than shuddered at"
"They have now succeeded in taking the Radicals by surprise in profiting by the general reaction in favour of Conservative principles and of the leading canton the seat of the federal Government for the time being"
"Luzern being a Conservative Canton"
"The democratic party in Valais is for the moment overwhelmed"
"The interference of the federal Government will be required it remains to be seen what profit the priests who accompanied the Conservative army and headed it will make of their victory but at any rate there is no chance even now to re establish anything like the old system or to keep the Lower Valais and its spirited inhabitants in a state of subjection"

"There has been a serious turn out of colliers at Rive de Jier near Lyons for wages and other grievances"
"This affair offered upon the whole the same features as the English strikes processions with banners meetings molesting of knobsticks c."

"At last the men are reported to have returned to their pits though it is not stated whether the object of the strike was accomplished"
"The following account of the gathering of the Republican forces upon the occasion of the funeral of the deceased M. Laffitte from the pen of the correspondent of the Weekly Dispatch will be found interesting as showing the great strength of the Republicans in Paris and the certainty of a speedy revolution in that country"
"May 30 1844 the Republican party nevertheless made a powerful demonstration of its strength"
"Five thousand students belonging to the schools of law and medicine assembled to do honour to a man whose whole life with one fatal exception had been devoted to the cause of political liberty"
"For that one error viz conferring the Crown upon Louis Philip 234 he partially atoned in the Chamber of Deputies by imploring pardon of God and of man for the grievous injury he had been instrumental in inflicting upon France and the civilised world"
"The five thousand students who followed him to his last home are all staunch Republican spirits all glowing for political liberty"
"These noble minded young men together with the military students of the Polytechnic Schools are the hope of young France"
"Let them eradicate from their breasts that absurd animosity towards England which would lead them to plunge into war for the mere purpose of settling the question of national rivalry over again let them learn to respect their island ally as a power advancing with them hand in hand in the road of civilisation and those young men the rising generation whom the Conservative press of both nations affect to despise will one day be called upon to decide the destinies of France"
"In the Revolution of 1830 military students of sixteen and eighteen years of age became the generals of the people in that dreadful struggle with the royal troops"
"At the death of Louis Philippe the Republicans will no doubt proclaim their principles to be those alone adapted to France and French interests and the young students of Paris must co operate with and advise the people in the political arena as readily and faithfully as they led them on to victory fourteen years ago"
"But the demonstration of Republican strength on the occasion of the funeral of M. Laffitte was not confined to the law and medical students"
"The members of those formidable political combinations assembled in immense numbers"
"They formed a column four deep and marched immediately in front of the students"
"A third section of the Republican party also followed Laffitte to the cemetery of P � re La Chaise"
"The friends of liberty therefore mustered strong upon this occasion"
"Indeed it is absurd for the Conservative press to deny the fact that the numerical strength and the moral influences of the French Republican party are immense"
"Ranking amongst its numbers some of the most exalted names in France names respectively famous in the spheres of war literature art science and policy gaining strength daily by the acquisition of those whom the tyranny of the King alienates from the Orleans cause and professing principles which accord with the new interests and new wants of civilisation the Republican party is the one to which all eyes will be turned the moment any unforeseen accident or natural occurrence disturbs the reign of the Orleans dynasty"

"The people have achieved a great triumph they have by their steady and protracted opposition forced the King Frederick William IV to abandon his pet measure the proposed new law of divorce"
"The present law in this respect is very liberal and of course never pleased"
"Ever since his accession to the throne he was big with an amended law by which a divorce was to be granted in very few cases only"
"The holiness of the marriage bond was to be enforced as strictly as possible and another door to be opened to the parsons to meddle with the family affairs of other people"
"The spirit of the nation however arose against such a law the press opposed it and when a democratic paper Rheinische Zeitung succeeded in getting and publishing an authentic abstract of the proposed law a general outcry was raised against it from one end of the country to the other"
"Nevertheless the King persisted in his intention"
"Whether there was already a strong opposition in the Privy Council or whether the King saw that this measure would never pass the provincial Parliaments nay be difficult to decide it is enough that an ordinance dated the 11th instant has been directed to the Council withdrawing the bill abandoning entirely its principle and declaring that the King will be satisfied with the alteration of a few formalities of the present law"
"This most important triumph of the opposition must strengthen permanently the popular party and will be received with cheers in every hamlet of the realm"
"It will show the people that they are strong and that if united they may defeat any measure they do not like nay that by merely using their strength they may frighten the government into any thing they please"
"In the manufacturing district of Silesia very serious riots have occurred the workpeople of the neighbourhood depending almost entirely upon the linen manufacture and suffering great distress not being able to stand the competition against the English machine made article have for some time been in a condition similar to that of the English hand loom weavers"

"In Langenbielau outrages of a similar nature were committed the military were repelled by the people and could only restore the peace after having received reinforcements and fired on the rioters of whom several were killed"
"In other districts tumultuous assemblages took place and even in the capital of the province Breslau the peace was disturbed"

"The riots commenced as stated in my last at Peterswalden in the District of Reichenbach the centre of the manufacturing part of Silesia"
"The weavers assembled before the house of one of the most respectable manufacturers of the name of Zwanziger singing a song in which the behaviour of this individual towards his workmen was animadverted upon and which seems to have been manufactured for the occasion"
"241"">[241 Mr. Zwanziger sent for the police and got several of the ringleaders arrested the people assembled in growing numbers before his door threatened to rescue them and the prisoners not being liberated they immediately commenced the work of destruction"
"The doors were forced the windows smashed the crowd entered the house and destroyed every thing within their reach"
"Zwanziger ’s family had hardly time to save themselves and the throwing of stones at them was so incessant that it was found necessary to wrap up in bedding the female part of the family and have them carried in a coach to Schweidnitz"
"To this place messengers also were sent to call in the aid of the military but the commanding officer replied he could do nothing without orders from the provincial authorities at Breslau"
"The people in the meantime entirely demolished the dwelling house of Mr. Zwanziger and proceeded then to the warehouse where they destroyed all books bills of exchange and other documents and threw the cash they found amounting to upwards of � 1,000 upon the street where it was picked up by a lot of Bohemian smugglers who had passed the frontier to see whether they could not profit by the riots"
"The bales of cotton and bags as well as all the manufactured yarn and goods were as far as possible destroyed or made useless and the machinery in the adjoining factory entirely broke"
"Having finished up here they left the ruins of the demolished buildings and proceeded to Langenbielau the men of which town joined them immediately and where Mr. Dierig ’s factory and warehouse was attacked"
"Mr. Dierig first tried to buy them off but after having paid part of his bargain he was informed that the military were on the road and he immediately refused to pay the remainder"
"The crowd immediately forced their way to the premises and demolished them in the same way as they had done at Peterswalden while they were engaged in this a detachment of about 160 foot soldiers arrived with the civil authorities the Riot Act was read the people replied by throwing stones at the military then the word to fire was given and twelve of the rioters were killed and many wounded"
"But the enraged crowd rushed on against the soldiers and wounded such a number of them by stones that the commanding officer who had been dragged from his horse and severely beaten retreated with them to await reinforcements while the destruction of property continued going on"
"At last two battalions of infantry a company of rifles some cavalry and artillery appeared and dispersed the rioters"
"Further attempts at similar proceedings were stifled by the military keeping the town and surrounding places occupied and as usual when everything was over the proper authorities came forward with proclamations and such like declaring the district in a state of siege and threatened the most horrible punishments for every breach of the peace"
"The riots were not confined to these two towns in Alt Friedland and Leutmansdorf similar scenes took place though not characterised by such a violent manifestation of feeling towards the manufacturers some arms were broke and some windows were smashed before the military could restore tranquillity"
"The people throughout the district profited on this occasion by giving to the manufacturers such a display of their feelings as could not be mistaken"
"It will scarcely be believed that the wages of this oppressed class in a family where father mother and children worked all of them at the loom amounted to a sum which would buy no more than six shillings would in England"
"Besides they were all in debt which is not at all a matter of surprise when wages are so low and the manufacturers gladly advanced them small sums which the men could never pay but which were sufficient to give the masters an absolute sovereignty over them and to make them the slaves of the manufacturers"
"Then there was besides that the competition of the English article which had an advantage over them from the superior machinery of the English factories and the low wages there and which tended to bring down their wages too"
"It is to be noticed that during all these disturbances according to the statements of all German papers not one single robbery has been committed by the starving weavers"
"They left the stealing and plunder to the Bohemian smugglers and poachers"

"We had to call in the fat pig and his decision was that it was essential to have a wet nurse since with artificial feeding she would not easily recover"
"You can imagine my anxiety"

"When I rang my heart was beating almost audibly"
"Everything went through my mind"

"Both immediately embraced me your mother called me thou and Sophie sat me on the sofa beside her"
"She has been terribly ravaged by illness looks like CxC and is hardly likely to get well again"
"And yet Jettchen is in an almost worse state"
"Only your mother looks well and flourishing and is cheerfulness itself almost gay and frolicsome"
"Alas this gaiety seems somehow sinister"
"All the girls were equally affectionate especially little Caroline"
"Next morning your mother came already at 9 o'clock to see the baby"
"In the afternoon Sophie came and this morning little Caroline also paid a visit to our little angel"
