    "For those who are not familiar with the syntax of python (or, if you're familiar with R programming), you might wonder what requests.get or wikiContentRequest.text mean. To understand this, you need to first understand what objects are. You may have heard that Python is an object oriented programming language (unlike the procedure oriented programming language, an example of which is R). Object is a set of variables (or, data) and functions into which you pass your data. So, in object oriented programming languages, like python, variables and functions are bunleded into objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at wikiContentRequest. We use dir() function, which returns the list of attributes and functions of objects."

      "agreement or by conquest, and which is still accompanied by slavery.\r\n",
      "Beside communal ownership we already find movable, and later also\r\n",

      "subordinate to communal ownership. The citizens hold power over their\r\n",

      "slaves. For this reason the whole structure of society based on this\r\n",
      "communal ownership, and with it the power of the people, decays in the\r\n",

      "states which represent town interests and those which represent country\r\n",
      "interests, and inside the towns themselves the antagonism between\r\n",

      "concentration of private property, which began very early in Rome (as\r\n",
      "the Licinian agrarian law proves) and proceeded very rapidly from the\r\n",

      "The third form of ownership is feudal or estate property. If antiquity\r\n",
      "started out from the town and its little territory, the Middle Ages started\r\n",
      "out from the country. This different starting-point was determined by the\r\n",
      "sparseness of the population at that time, which was scattered over a\r\n",
      "large area and which received no large increase from the conquerors. In\r\n",
      "contrast to Greece and Rome, feudal development at the outset,\r\n",

      "declined, industry had decayed for want of a market, trade had died out\r\n",

      "decreased. From these conditions and the mode of organisation of the\r\n",

      "towns. The hierarchical structure of land ownership, and the armed\r\n",
      "bodies of retainers associated with it, gave the nobility power over the\r\n",

      "communal ownership, an association against a subjected producing\r\n",
      "class; but the form of association and the relation to the direct producers\r\n",
      "were different because of the different conditions of production.\r\n",
      "</p>, <p>\r\n",
      "This feudal system of land ownership had its counterpart in the <i>towns</i>\r\n",
