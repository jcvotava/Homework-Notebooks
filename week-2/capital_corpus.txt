17,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,” its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.  ",Commodities
18,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference. Neither are we here concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or indirectly as means of production.  ",Commodities
19,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Every useful thing, as iron, paper, &c., may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity. It is an assemblage of many properties, and may therefore be of use in various ways. To discover the various uses of things is the work of history. So also is the establishment of socially-recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, partly in convention.  ",Commodities
20,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The utility of a thing makes it a use value. Use values become a reality only by use or consumption: they also constitute the substance of all wealth, whatever may be the social form of that wealth. In the form of society we are about to consider, they are, in addition, the material depositories of exchange value.  ",Commodities
21,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Exchange value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation, as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort, Let us consider the matter a little more closely.   ",Commodities
22,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A given commodity, e.g., a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c. – in short, for other commodities in the most different proportions. Instead of one exchange value, the wheat has, therefore, a great many. But since x blacking, y silk, or z gold &c., each represents the exchange value of one quarter of wheat, x blacking, y silk, z gold, &c., must, as exchange values, be replaceable by each other, or equal to each other. Therefore, first: the valid exchange values of a given commodity express something equal; secondly, exchange value, generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it.   ",Commodities
23,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Let us take two commodities, e.g., corn and iron. The proportions in which they are exchangeable, whatever those proportions may be, can always be represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron: e.g., 1 quarter corn = x cwt. iron. What does this equation tell us? It tells us that in two different things – in 1 quarter of corn and x cwt. of iron, there exists in equal quantities something common to both. The two things must therefore be equal to a third, which in itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of them, so far as it is exchange value, must therefore be reducible to this third.   ",Commodities
24,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A simple geometrical illustration will make this clear. In order to calculate and compare the areas of rectilinear figures, we decompose them into triangles. But the area of the triangle itself is expressed by something totally different from its visible figure, namely, by half the product of the base multiplied by the altitude. In the same way the exchange values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all, of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity.  ",Commodities
25,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  This common “something” cannot be either a geometrical, a chemical, or any other natural property of commodities. Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities, make them use values. But the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value. Then one use value is just as good as another, provided only it be present in sufficient quantity. Or, as old Barbon says,",Commodities
26,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"   “one sort of wares are as good as another, if the values be equal. There is no difference or distinction in things of equal value ... An hundred pounds’ worth of lead or iron, is of as great value as one hundred pounds’ worth of silver or gold.”",Commodities
27,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  As use values, commodities are, above all, of different qualities, but as exchange values they are merely different quantities, and consequently do not contain an atom of use value.     ",Commodities
28,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  If then we leave out of consideration the use value of commodities, they have only one common property left, that of being products of labour. But even the product of labour itself has undergone a change in our hands. If we make abstraction from its use value, we make abstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use value; we see in it no longer a table, a house, yarn, or any other useful thing. Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight. Neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner, the mason, the spinner, or of any other definite kind of productive labour. Along with the useful qualities of the products themselves, we put out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them, and the concrete forms of that labour; there is nothing left but what is common to them all; all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour, human labour in the abstract.   ",Commodities
29,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Let us now consider the residue of each of these products; it consists of the same unsubstantial reality in each, a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour, of labour power expended without regard to the mode of its expenditure. All that these things now tell us is, that human labour power has been expended in their production, that human labour is embodied in them. When looked at as crystals of this social substance, common to them all, they are – Values.   ",Commodities
30,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  We have seen that when commodities are exchanged, their exchange value manifests itself as something totally independent of their use value. But if we abstract from their use value, there remains their Value as defined above. Therefore, the common substance that manifests itself in the exchange value of commodities, whenever they are exchanged, is their value. The progress of our investigation will show that exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed. For the present, however, we have to consider the nature of value independently of this, its form.   ",Commodities
31,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A use value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because human labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it. How, then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured? Plainly, by the quantity of the value-creating substance, the labour, contained in the article. The quantity of labour, however, is measured by its duration, and labour time in its turn finds its standard in weeks, days, and hours.   ",Commodities
32,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour spent on it, the more idle and unskilful the labourer, the more valuable would his commodity be, because more time would be required in its production. The labour, however, that forms the substance of value, is homogeneous human labour, expenditure of one uniform labour power. The total labour power of society, which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society, counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labour power, composed though it be of innumerable individual units. Each of these units is the same as any other, so far as it has the character of the average labour power of society, and takes effect as such; that is, so far as it requires for producing a commodity, no more time than is needed on an average, no more than is socially necessary. The labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time. The introduction of power-looms into England probably reduced by one-half the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth. The hand-loom weavers, as a matter of fact, continued to require the same time as before; but for all that, the product of one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hour’s social labour, and consequently fell to one-half its former value.         ",Commodities
33,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  We see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount of labour socially necessary, or the labour time socially necessary for its production.  ",Commodities
34,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant, if the labour time required for its production also remained constant. But the latter changes with every variation in the productiveness of labour. This productiveness is determined by various circumstances, amongst others, by the average amount of skill of the workmen, the state of science, and the degree of its practical application, the social organisation of production, the extent and capabilities of the means of production, and by physical conditions. For example, the same amount of labour in favourable seasons is embodied in 8 bushels of corn, and in unfavourable, only in four. The same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines. Diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth’s surface, and hence their discovery costs, on an average, a great deal of labour time. Consequently much labour is represented in a small compass. Jacob doubts whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value. This applies still more to diamonds. According to Eschwege, the total produce of the Brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years, ending in 1823, had not realised the price of one-and-a-half years’ average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations of the same country, although the diamonds cost much more labour, and therefore represented more value. With richer mines, the same quantity of labour would embody itself in more diamonds, and their value would fall. If we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour, in converting carbon into diamonds, their value might fall below that of bricks. In general, the greater the productiveness of labour, the less is the labour time required for the production of an article, the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article, and the less is its value; and vice versâ, the less the productiveness of labour, the greater is the labour time required for the production of an article, and the greater is its value. The value of a commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productiveness, of the labour incorporated in it.   ",Commodities
35,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use values, but use values for others, social use values. (And not only for others, without more. The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others. To become a commodity a product must be transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use value, by means of an exchange.) Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value.   ",Commodities
38,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  At first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two things – use value and exchange value. Later on, we saw also that labour, too, possesses the same two-fold nature; for, so far as it finds expression in value, it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as a creator of use values. I was the first to point out and to examine critically this two-fold nature of the labour contained in commodities. As this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of political economy turns, we must go more into detail.   ",Commodities
39,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen, and let the former be double the value of the latter, so that, if 10 yards of linen = W, the coat = 2W.   ",Commodities
40,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The coat is a use value that satisfies a particular want. Its existence is the result of a special sort of productive activity, the nature of which is determined by its aim, mode of operation, subject, means, and result. The labour, whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product, or which manifests itself by making its product a use value, we call useful labour. In this connection we consider only its useful effect.   ",Commodities
41,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  As the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different use values, so also are the two forms of labour that produce them, tailoring and weaving. Were these two objects not qualitatively different, not produced respectively by labour of different quality, they could not stand to each other in the relation of commodities. Coats are not exchanged for coats, one use value is not exchanged for another of the same kind.   ",Commodities
42,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  To all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful labour, classified according to the order, genus, species, and variety to which they belong in the social division of labour. This division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of commodities, but it does not follow, conversely, that the production of commodities is a necessary condition for the division of labour. In the primitive Indian community there is social division of labour, without production of commodities. Or, to take an example nearer home, in every factory the labour is divided according to a system, but this division is not brought about by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual products. Only such products can become commodities with regard to each other, as result from different kinds of labour, each kind being carried on independently and for the account of private individuals.   ",Commodities
43,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  To resume, then: In the use value of each commodity there is contained useful labour, i.e., productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim. Use values cannot confront each other as commodities, unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them. In a community, the produce of which in general takes the form of commodities, i.e., in a community of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently of individual producers, each on their own account, develops into a complex system, a social division of labour.   ",Commodities
44,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Anyhow, whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer, in either case it operates as a use value. Nor is the relation between the coat and the labour that produced it altered by the circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade, an independent branch of the social division of labour. Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it, the human race made clothes for thousands of years, without a single man becoming a tailor. But coats and linen, like every other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of Nature, must invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity, exercised with a definite aim, an activity that appropriates particular nature-given materials to particular human wants. So far therefore as labour is a creator of use value, is useful labour, it is a necessary condition, independent of all forms of society, for the existence of the human race; it is an eternal nature-imposed necessity, without which there can be no material exchanges between man and Nature, and therefore no life.    ",Commodities
45,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The use values, coat, linen, &c., i.e., the bodies of commodities, are combinations of two elements – matter and labour. If we take away the useful labour expended upon them, a material substratum is always left, which is furnished by Nature without the help of man. The latter can work only as Nature does, that is by changing the form of matter. Nay more, in this work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces. We see, then, that labour is not the only source of material wealth, of use values produced by labour. As William Petty puts it, labour is its father and the earth its mother.   ",Commodities
46,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  Let us now pass from the commodity considered as a use value to the value of commodities.   ,Commodities
47,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  By our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the linen. But this is a mere quantitative difference, which for the present does not concern us. We bear in mind, however, that if the value of the coat is double that of 10 yds of linen, 20 yds of linen must have the same value as one coat. So far as they are values, the coat and the linen are things of a like substance, objective expressions of essentially identical labour. But tailoring and weaving are, qualitatively, different kinds of labour. There are, however, states of society in which one and the same man does tailoring and weaving alternately, in which case these two forms of labour are mere modifications of the labour of the same individual, and not special and fixed functions of different persons, just as the coat which our tailor makes one day, and the trousers which he makes another day, imply only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual. Moreover, we see at a glance that, in our capitalist society, a given portion of human labour is, in accordance with the varying demand, at one time supplied in the form of tailoring, at another in the form of weaving. This change may possibly not take place without friction, but take place it must.      ",Commodities
48,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Productive activity, if we leave out of sight its special form, viz., the useful character of the labour, is nothing but the expenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving, though qualitatively different productive activities, are each a productive expenditure of human brains, nerves, and muscles, and in this sense are human labour. They are but two different modes of expending human labour power. Of course, this labour power, which remains the same under all its modifications, must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in a multiplicity of modes. But the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract, the expenditure of human labour in general. And just as in society, a general or a banker plays a great part, but mere man, on the other hand, a very shabby part, The different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their standard, are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers, and, consequently, appear to be fixed by custom. For simplicity’s sake we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be unskilled, simple labour; by this we do no more than save ourselves the trouble of making the reduction.   ",Commodities
49,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Just as, therefore, in viewing the coat and linen as values, we abstract from their different use values, so it is with the labour represented by those values: we disregard the difference between its useful forms, weaving and tailoring. As the use values, coat and linen, are combinations of special productive activities with cloth and yarn, while the values, coat and linen, are, on the other hand, mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour, so the labour embodied in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but only as being expenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation of the use values, coat and linen, precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities; but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities, only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour, do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the values of the same articles.   ",Commodities
50,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Coats and linen, however, are not merely values, but values of definite magnitude, and according to our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of linen. Whence this difference in their values? It is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour as the coat, and consequently, that in the production of the latter, labour power must have been expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former.   ",Commodities
51,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  While, therefore, with reference to use value, the labour contained in a commodity counts only qualitatively, with reference to value it counts only quantitatively, and must first be reduced to human labour pure and simple. In the former case, it is a question of How and What, in the latter of How much? How long a time? Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it, it follows that all commodities, when taken in certain proportions, must be equal in value.   ",Commodities
52,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  If the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a coat remains unchanged, the sum of the values of the coats produced increases with their number. If one coat represents x days’ labour, two coats represent 2x days’ labour, and so on. But assume that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled or halved. In the first case one coat is worth as much as two coats were before; in the second case, two coats are only worth as much as one was before, although in both cases one coat renders the same service as before, and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the same quality. But the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered.   ",Commodities
53,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  An increase in the quantity of use values is an increase of material wealth. With two coats two men can be clothed, with one coat only one man. Nevertheless, an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value. This antagonistic movement has its origin in the two-fold character of labour. Productive power has reference, of course, only to labour of some useful concrete form, the efficacy of any special productive activity during a given time being dependent on its productiveness. Useful labour becomes, therefore, a more or less abundant source of products, in proportion to the rise or fall of its productiveness. On the other hand, no change in this productiveness affects the labour represented by value. Since productive power is an attribute of the concrete useful forms of labour, of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour, so soon as we make abstraction from those concrete useful forms. However then productive power may vary, the same labour, exercised during equal periods of time, always yields equal amounts of value. But it will yield, during equal periods of time, different quantities of values in use; more, if the productive power rise, fewer, if it fall. The same change in productive power, which increases the fruitfulness of labour, and, in consequence, the quantity of use values produced by that labour, will diminish the total value of this increased quantity of use values, provided such change shorten the total labour time necessary for their production; and vice versâ.    ",Commodities
54,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  On the one hand all labour is, speaking physiologically, an expenditure of human labour power, and in its character of identical abstract human labour, it creates and forms the value of commodities. On the other hand, all labour is the expenditure of human labour power in a special form and with a definite aim, and in this, its character of concrete useful labour, it produces use values.   ",Commodities
57,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Commodities come into the world in the shape of use values, articles, or goods, such as iron, linen, corn, &c. This is their plain, homely, bodily form. They are, however, commodities, only because they are something two-fold, both objects of utility, and, at the same time, depositories of value. They manifest themselves therefore as commodities, or have the form of commodities, only in so far as they have two forms, a physical or natural form, and a value form.   ",Commodities
58,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame Quickly, that we don’t know “where to have it.” The value of commodities is the very opposite of the coarse materiality of their substance, not an atom of matter enters into its composition. Turn and examine a single commodity, by itself, as we will, yet in so far as it remains an object of value, it seems impossible to grasp it. If, however, we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely social reality, and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one identical social substance, viz., human labour, it follows as a matter of course, that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity. In fact we started from exchange value, or the exchange relation of commodities, in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it. We must now return to this form under which value first appeared to us.   ",Commodities
59,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Every one knows, if he knows nothing else, that commodities have a value form common to them all, and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their use values. I mean their money form. Here, however, a task is set us, the performance of which has never yet even been attempted by bourgeois economy, the task of tracing the genesis of this money form, of developing the expression of value implied in the value relation of commodities, from its simplest, almost imperceptible outline, to the dazzling money-form. By doing this we shall, at the same time, solve the riddle presented by money.   ",Commodities
60,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  The simplest value-relation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of a different kind. Hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity.     ,Commodities

63,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"   The whole mystery of the form of value lies hidden in this elementary form. Its analysis, therefore, is our real difficulty.   ",Commodities
64,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Here two different kinds of commodities (in our example the linen and the coat), evidently play two different parts. The linen expresses its value in the coat; the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed. The former plays an active, the latter a passive, part. The value of the linen is represented as relative value, or appears in relative form. The coat officiates as equivalent, or appears in equivalent form.   ",Commodities
65,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected, mutually dependent and inseparable elements of the expression of value; but, at the same time, are mutually exclusive, antagonistic extremes – i.e., poles of the same expression. They are allotted respectively to the two different commodities brought into relation by that expression. It is not possible to express the value of linen in linen. 20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen is no expression of value. On the contrary, such an equation merely says that 20 yards of linen are nothing else than 20 yards of linen, a definite quantity of the use value linen. The value of the linen can therefore be expressed only relatively – i.e., in some other commodity. The relative form of the value of the linen presupposes, therefore, the presence of some other commodity – here the coat – under the form of an equivalent. On the other hand, the commodity that figures as the equivalent cannot at the same time assume the relative form. That second commodity is not the one whose value is expressed. Its function is merely to serve as the material in which the value of the first commodity is expressed.   ",Commodities
66,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  No doubt, the expression 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat, implies the opposite relation. 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, or 1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen. But, in that case, I must reverse the equation, in order to express the value of the coat relatively; and so soon as I do that the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat. A single commodity cannot, therefore, simultaneously assume, in the same expression of value, both forms. The very polarity of these forms makes them mutually exclusive.   ",Commodities
67,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Whether, then, a commodity assumes the relative form, or the opposite equivalent form, depends entirely upon its accidental position in the expression of value – that is, upon whether it is the commodity whose value is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed.     ",Commodities
68,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  (a.) The nature and import of this form   ,Commodities
70,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a commodity lies hidden in the value relation of two commodities, we must, in the first place, consider the latter entirely apart from its quantitative aspect. The usual mode of procedure is generally the reverse, and in the value relation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite quantities of two different sorts of commodities that are considered equal to each other. It is apt to be forgotten that the magnitudes of different things can be compared quantitatively, only when those magnitudes are expressed in terms of the same unit. It is only as expressions of such a unit that they are of the same denomination, and therefore commensurable.  ",Commodities
71,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Whether 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 20 coats or = x coats – that is, whether a given quantity of linen is worth few or many coats, every such statement implies that the linen and coats, as magnitudes of value, are expressions of the same unit, things of the same kind. Linen = coat is the basis of the equation.   ",Commodities
72,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  But the two commodities whose identity of quality is thus assumed, do not play the same part. It is only the value of the linen that is expressed. And how? By its reference to the coat as its equivalent, as something that can be exchanged for it. In this relation the coat is the mode of existence of value, is value embodied, for only as such is it the same as the linen. On the other hand, the linen’s own value comes to the front, receives independent expression, for it is only as being value that it is comparable with the coat as a thing of equal value, or exchangeable with the coat. To borrow an illustration from chemistry, butyric acid is a different substance from propyl formate. Yet both are made up of the same chemical substances, carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), and that, too, in like proportions – namely, C4H8O2. If now we equate butyric acid to propyl formate, then, in the first place, propyl formate would be, in this relation, merely a form of existence of C4H8O2; and in the second place, we should be stating that butyric acid also consists of C4H8O2. Therefore, by thus equating the two substances, expression would be given to their chemical composition, while their different physical forms would be neglected.   ",Commodities
73,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  If we say that, as values, commodities are mere congelations of human labour, we reduce them by our analysis, it is true, to the abstraction, value; but we ascribe to this value no form apart from their bodily form. It is otherwise in the value relation of one commodity to another. Here, the one stands forth in its character of value by reason of its relation to the other.     ",Commodities
74,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  By making the coat the equivalent of the linen, we equate the labour embodied in the former to that in the latter. Now, it is true that the tailoring, which makes the coat, is concrete labour of a different sort from the weaving which makes the linen. But the act of equating it to the weaving, reduces the tailoring to that which is really equal in the two kinds of labour, to their common character of human labour. In this roundabout way, then, the fact is expressed, that weaving also, in so far as it weaves value, has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring, and, consequently, is abstract human labour. It is the expression of equivalence between different sorts of commodities that alone brings into relief the specific character of value-creating labour, and this it does by actually reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds of commodities to their common quality of human labour in the abstract.  ",Commodities
75,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  There is, however, something else required beyond the expression of the specific character of the labour of which the value of the linen consists. Human labour power in motion, or human labour, creates value, but is not itself value. It becomes value only in its congealed state, when embodied in the form of some object. In order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human labour, that value must be expressed as having objective existence, as being a something materially different from the linen itself, and yet a something common to the linen and all other commodities. The problem is already solved.   ",Commodities
76,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  When occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value, the coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen, as something of the same kind, because it is value. In this position it is a thing in which we see nothing but value, or whose palpable bodily form represents value. Yet the coat itself, the body of the commodity, coat, is a mere use value. A coat as such no more tells us it is value, than does the first piece of linen we take hold of. This shows that when placed in value-relation to the linen, the coat signifies more than when out of that relation, just as many a man strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti.   ",Commodities
77,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In the production of the coat, human labour power, in the shape of tailoring, must have been actually expended. Human labour is therefore accumulated in it. In this aspect the coat is a depository of value, but though worn to a thread, it does not let this fact show through. And as equivalent of the linen in the value equation, it exists under this aspect alone, counts therefore as embodied value, as a body that is value. A, for instance, cannot be “your majesty” to B, unless at the same time majesty in B’s eyes assumes the bodily form of A, and, what is more, with every new father of the people, changes its features, hair, and many other things besides.   ",Commodities
78,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Hence, in the value equation, in which the coat is the equivalent of the linen, the coat officiates as the form of value. The value of the commodity linen is expressed by the bodily form of the commodity coat, the value of one by the use value of the other. As a use value, the linen is something palpably different from the coat; as value, it is the same as the coat, and now has the appearance of a coat. Thus the linen acquires a value form different from its physical form. The fact that it is value, is made manifest by its equality with the coat, just as the sheep’s nature of a Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God.   ",Commodities
79,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  We see, then, all that our analysis of the value of commodities has already told us, is told us by the linen itself, so soon as it comes into communication with another commodity, the coat. Only it betrays its thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar, the language of commodities. In order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in its abstract character of human labour, it says that the coat, in so far as it is worth as much as the linen, and therefore is value, consists of the same labour as the linen. In order to inform us that its sublime reality as value is not the same as its buckram body, it says that value has the appearance of a coat, and consequently that so far as the linen is value, it and the coat are as like as two peas. We may here remark, that the language of commodities has, besides Hebrew, many other more or less correct dialects. The German “Wertsein,” to be worth, for instance, expresses in a less striking manner than the Romance verbs “valere,” “valer,” “valoir,” that the equating of commodity B to commodity A, is commodity A’s own mode of expressing its value. Paris vaut bien une messe.    ",Commodities
80,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  By means, therefore, of the value-relation expressed in our equation, the bodily form of commodity B becomes the value form of commodity A, or the body of commodity B acts as a mirror to the value of commodity A. By putting itself in relation with commodity B, as value in propriâ personâ, as the matter of which human labour is made up, the commodity A converts the value in use, B, into the substance in which to express its, A’s, own value. The value of A, thus expressed in the use value of B, has taken the form of relative value.     ",Commodities
81,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  (b.) Quantitative determination of Relative value    ,Commodities
83,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Every commodity, whose value it is intended to express, is a useful object of given quantity, as 15 bushels of corn, or 100 lbs of coffee. And a given quantity of any commodity contains a definite quantity of human labour. The value form must therefore not only express value generally, but also value in definite quantity. Therefore, in the value relation of commodity A to commodity B, of the linen to the coat, not only is the latter, as value in general, made the equal in quality of the linen, but a definite quantity of coat (1 coat) is made the equivalent of a definite quantity (20 yards) of linen.   ",Commodities
84,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The equation, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth one coat, implies that the same quantity of value substance (congealed labour) is embodied in both; that the two commodities have each cost the same amount of labour or the same quantity of labour time. But the labour time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring. We have now to consider the influence of such changes on the quantitative aspect of the relative expression of value.   ",Commodities
85,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  I. Let the value of the linen vary, that of the coat remaining constant. If, say in consequence of the exhaustion of flax-growing soil, the labour time necessary for the production of the linen be doubled, the value of the linen will also be doubled. Instead of the equation, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, we should have 20 yards of linen = 2 coats, since 1 coat would now contain only half the labour time embodied in 20 yards of linen. If, on the other hand, in consequence, say, of improved looms, this labour time be reduced by one-half, the value of the linen would fall by one-half. Consequently, we should have 20 yards of linen = ½ coat. The relative value of commodity A, i.e., its value expressed in commodity B, rises and falls directly as the value of A, the value of B being supposed constant.  ",Commodities
86,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  II. Let the value of the linen remain constant, while the value of the coat varies. If, under these circumstances, in consequence, for instance, of a poor crop of wool, the labour time necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled, we have instead of 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, 20 yards of linen = ½ coat. If, on the other hand, the value of the coat sinks by one-half, then 20 yards of linen = 2 coats. Hence, if the value of commodity A remain constant, its relative value expressed in commodity B rises and falls inversely as the value of B.   ",Commodities
87,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  If we compare the different cases in I and II, we see that the same change of magnitude in relative value may arise from totally opposite causes. Thus, the equation, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, becomes 20 yards of linen = 2 coats, either, because the value of the linen has doubled, or because the value of the coat has fallen by one-half; and it becomes 20 yards of linen = ½ coat, either, because the value of the linen has fallen by one-half, or because the value of the coat has doubled.  ",Commodities
88,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  III. Let the quantities of labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat vary simultaneously in the same direction and in the same proportion. In this case 20 yards of linen continue equal to 1 coat, however much their values may have altered. Their change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third commodity, whose value has remained constant. If the values of all commodities rose or fell simultaneously, and in the same proportion, their relative values would remain unaltered. Their real change of value would appear from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in a given time.  ",Commodities
89,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  IV. The labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat, and therefore the value of these commodities may simultaneously vary in the same direction, but at unequal rates or in opposite directions, or in other ways. The effect of all these possible different variations, on the relative value of a commodity, may be deduced from the results of I, II, and III.    ",Commodities
90,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor exhaustively reflected in their relative expression, that is, in the equation expressing the magnitude of relative value. The relative value of a commodity may vary, although its value remains constant. Its relative value may remain constant, although its value varies; and finally, simultaneous variations in the magnitude of value and in that of its relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in amount.  ",Commodities
91,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  We have seen that commodity A (the linen), by expressing its value in the use value of a commodity differing in kind (the coat), at the same time impresses upon the latter a specific form of value, namely that of the equivalent. The commodity linen manifests its quality of having a value by the fact that the coat, without having assumed a value form different from its bodily form, is equated to the linen. The fact that the latter therefore has a value is expressed by saying that the coat is directly exchangeable with it. Therefore, when we say that a commodity is in the equivalent form, we express the fact that it is directly exchangeable with other commodities.   ",Commodities
92,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  When one commodity, such as a coat, serves as the equivalent of another, such as linen, and coats consequently acquire the characteristic property of being directly exchangeable with linen, we are far from knowing in what proportion the two are exchangeable. The value of the linen being given in magnitude, that proportion depends on the value of the coat. Whether the coat serves as the equivalent and the linen as relative value, or the linen as the equivalent and the coat as relative value, the magnitude of the coat’s value is determined, independently of its value form, by the labour time necessary for its production. But whenever the coat assumes in the equation of value, the position of equivalent, its value acquires no quantitative expression; on the contrary, the commodity coat now figures only as a definite quantity of some article.   ",Commodities
93,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  For instance, 40 yards of linen are worth – what? 2 coats. Because the commodity coat here plays the part of equivalent, because the use-value coat, as opposed to the linen, figures as an embodiment of value, therefore a definite number of coats suffices to express the definite quantity of value in the linen. Two coats may therefore express the quantity of value of 40 yards of linen, but they can never express the quantity of their own value. A superficial observation of this fact, namely, that in the equation of value, the equivalent figures exclusively as a simple quantity of some article, of some use value, has misled Bailey, as also many others, both before and after him, into seeing, in the expression of value, merely a quantitative relation. The truth being, that when a commodity acts as equivalent, no quantitative determination of its value is expressed.   ",Commodities
94,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The first peculiarity that strikes us, in considering the form of the equivalent, is this: use value becomes the form of manifestation, the phenomenal form of its opposite, value.   ",Commodities
95,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The bodily form of the commodity becomes its value form. But, mark well, that this quid pro quo exists in the case of any commodity B, only when some other commodity A enters into a value relation with it, and then only within the limits of this relation. Since no commodity can stand in the relation of equivalent to itself, and thus turn its own bodily shape into the expression of its own value, every commodity is compelled to choose some other commodity for its equivalent, and to accept the use value, that is to say, the bodily shape of that other commodity as the form of its own value.   ",Commodities
96,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  One of the measures that we apply to commodities as material substances, as use values, will serve to illustrate this point. A sugar-loaf being a body, is heavy, and therefore has weight: but we can neither see nor touch this weight. We then take various pieces of iron, whose weight has been determined beforehand. The iron, as iron, is no more the form of manifestation of weight, than is the sugar-loaf. Nevertheless, in order to express the sugar-loaf as so much weight, we put it into a weight-relation with the iron. In this relation, the iron officiates as a body representing nothing but weight. A certain quantity of iron therefore serves as the measure of the weight of the sugar, and represents, in relation to the sugar-loaf, weight embodied, the form of manifestation of weight. This part is played by the iron only within this relation, into which the sugar or any other body, whose weight has to be determined, enters with the iron. Were they not both heavy, they could not enter into this relation, and the one could therefore not serve as the expression of the weight of the other. When we throw both into the scales, we see in reality, that as weight they are both the same, and that, therefore, when taken in proper proportions, they have the same weight. Just as the substance iron, as a measure of weight, represents in relation to the sugar-loaf weight alone, so, in our expression of value, the material object, coat, in relation to the linen, represents value alone.   ",Commodities
97,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Here, however, the analogy ceases. The iron, in the expression of the weight of the sugar-loaf, represents a natural property common to both bodies, namely their weight; but the coat, in the expression of value of the linen, represents a non-natural property of both, something purely social, namely, their value.    ",Commodities
98,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Since the relative form of value of a commodity – the linen, for example – expresses the value of that commodity, as being something wholly different from its substance and properties, as being, for instance, coat-like, we see that this expression itself indicates that some social relation lies at the bottom of it. With the equivalent form it is just the contrary. The very essence of this form is that the material commodity itself – the coat – just as it is, expresses value, and is endowed with the form of value by Nature itself. Of course this holds good only so long as the value relation exists, in which the coat stands in the position of equivalent to the linen. Since, however, the properties of a thing are not the result of its relations to other things, but only manifest themselves in such relations, the coat seems to be endowed with its equivalent form, its property of being directly exchangeable, just as much by Nature as it is endowed with the property of being heavy, or the capacity to keep us warm. Hence the enigmatical character of the equivalent form which escapes the notice of the bourgeois political economist, until this form, completely developed, confronts him in the shape of money. He then seeks to explain away the mystical character of gold and silver, by substituting for them less dazzling commodities, and by reciting, with ever renewed satisfaction, the catalogue of all possible commodities which at one time or another have played the part of equivalent. He has not the least suspicion that the most simple expression of value, such as 20 yds of linen = 1 coat, already propounds the riddle of the equivalent form for our solution.   ",Commodities
99,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The body of the commodity that serves as the equivalent, figures as the materialisation of human labour in the abstract, and is at the same time the product of some specifically useful concrete labour. This concrete labour becomes, therefore, the medium for expressing abstract human labour. If on the one hand the coat ranks as nothing but the embodiment of abstract human labour, so, on the other hand, the tailoring which is actually embodied in it, counts as nothing but the form under which that abstract labour is realised. In the expression of value of the linen, the utility of the tailoring consists, not in making clothes, but in making an object, which we at once recognise to be Value, and therefore to be a congelation of labour, but of labour indistinguishable from that realised in the value of the linen. In order to act as such a mirror of value, the labour of tailoring must reflect nothing besides its own abstract quality of being human labour generally.   ",Commodities
100,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In tailoring, as well as in weaving, human labour power is expended. Both, therefore, possess the general property of being human labour, and may, therefore, in certain cases, such as in the production of value, have to be considered under this aspect alone. There is nothing mysterious in this. But in the expression of value there is a complete turn of the tables. For instance, how is the fact to be expressed that weaving creates the value of the linen, not by virtue of being weaving, as such, but by reason of its general property of being human labour? Simply by opposing to weaving that other particular form of concrete labour (in this instance tailoring), which produces the equivalent of the product of weaving. Just as the coat in its bodily form became a direct expression of value, so now does tailoring, a concrete form of labour, appear as the direct and palpable embodiment of human labour generally.   ",Commodities
101,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Hence, the second peculiarity of the equivalent form is, that concrete labour becomes the form under which its opposite, abstract human labour, manifests itself.   ",Commodities
102,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  But because this concrete labour, tailoring in our case, ranks as, and is directly identified with, undifferentiated human labour, it also ranks as identical with any other sort of labour, and therefore with that embodied in the linen. Consequently, although, like all other commodity-producing labour, it is the labour of private individuals, yet, at the same time, it ranks as labour directly social in its character. This is the reason why it results in a product directly exchangeable with other commodities. We have then a third peculiarity of the equivalent form, namely, that the labour of private individuals takes the form of its opposite, labour directly social in its form.   ",Commodities
103,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The two latter peculiarities of the equivalent form will become more intelligible if we go back to the great thinker who was the first to analyse so many forms, whether of thought, society, or Nature, and amongst them also the form of value. I mean Aristotle.   ",Commodities
104,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In the first place, he clearly enunciates that the money form of commodities is only the further development of the simple form of value – i.e., of the expression of the value of one commodity in some other commodity taken at random; for he says:  ",Commodities
105,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  5 beds = 1 house (clinai pente anti oiciaς)   ,Commodities
106,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  is not to be distinguished from  ,Commodities
107,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  5 beds = so much money. (clinai pente anti ... oson ai pente clinai)   ,Commodities
108,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  He further sees that the value relation which gives rise to this expression makes it necessary that the house should qualitatively be made the equal of the bed, and that, without such an equalisation, these two clearly different things could not be compared with each other as commensurable quantities. “Exchange,” he says, “cannot take place without equality, and equality not without commensurability"". (out isothς mh oushς snmmetriaς). Here, however, he comes to a stop, and gives up the further analysis of the form of value. “It is, however, in reality, impossible (th men oun alhqeia adunaton), that such unlike things can be commensurable” – i.e., qualitatively equal. Such an equalisation can only be something foreign to their real nature, consequently only “a makeshift for practical purposes.”   ",Commodities
109,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Aristotle therefore, himself, tells us what barred the way to his further analysis; it was the absence of any concept of value. What is that equal something, that common substance, which admits of the value of the beds being expressed by a house? Such a thing, in truth, cannot exist, says Aristotle. And why not? Compared with the beds, the house does represent something equal to them, in so far as it represents what is really equal, both in the beds and the house. And that is – human labour.   ",Commodities
110,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  There was, however, an important fact which prevented Aristotle from seeing that, to attribute value to commodities, is merely a mode of expressing all labour as equal human labour, and consequently as labour of equal quality. Greek society was founded upon slavery, and had, therefore, for its natural basis, the inequality of men and of their labour powers. The secret of the expression of value, namely, that all kinds of labour are equal and equivalent, because, and so far as they are human labour in general, cannot be deciphered, until the notion of human equality has already acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice. This, however, is possible only in a society in which the great mass of the produce of labour takes the form of commodities, in which, consequently, the dominant relation between man and man, is that of owners of commodities. The brilliancy of Aristotle’s genius is shown by this alone, that he discovered, in the expression of the value of commodities, a relation of equality. The peculiar conditions of the society in which he lived, alone prevented him from discovering what, “in truth,” was at the bottom of this equality.   ",Commodities
111,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The elementary form of value of a commodity is contained in the equation, expressing its value relation to another commodity of a different kind, or in its exchange relation to the same. The value of commodity A, is qualitatively expressed, by the fact that commodity B is directly exchangeable with it. Its value is quantitatively expressed by the fact, that a definite quantity of B is exchangeable with a definite quantity of A. In other words, the value of a commodity obtains independent and definite expression, by taking the form of exchange value. When, at the beginning of this chapter, we said, in common parlance, that a commodity is both a use value and an exchange value, we were, accurately speaking, wrong. A commodity is a use value or object of utility, and a value. It manifests itself as this two-fold thing, that it is, as soon as its value assumes an independent form – viz., the form of exchange value. It never assumes this form when isolated, but only when placed in a value or exchange relation with another commodity of a different kind. When once we know this, such a mode of expression does no harm; it simply serves as an abbreviation.    ",Commodities
112,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Our analysis has shown, that the form or expression of the value of a commodity originates in the nature of value, and not that value and its magnitude originate in the mode of their expression as exchange value. This, however, is the delusion as well of the mercantilists and their recent revivers, Ferrier, Ganilh, and others, as also of their antipodes, the modern bagmen of Free-trade, such as Bastiat. The mercantilists lay special stress on the qualitative aspect of the expression of value, and consequently on the equivalent form of commodities, which attains its full perfection in money. The modern hawkers of Free-trade, who must get rid of their article at any price, on the other hand, lay most stress on the quantitative aspect of the relative form of value. For them there consequently exists neither value, nor magnitude of value, anywhere except in its expression by means of the exchange relation of commodities, that is, in the daily list of prices current. Macleod, who has taken upon himself to dress up the confused ideas of Lombard Street in the most learned finery, is a successful cross between the superstitious mercantilists, and the enlightened Free-trade bagmen.   ",Commodities
113,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A close scrutiny of the expression of the value of A in terms of B, contained in the equation expressing the value relation of A to B, has shown us that, within that relation, the bodily form of A figures only as a use value, the bodily form of B only as the form or aspect of value. The opposition or contrast existing internally in each commodity between use value and value, is, therefore, made evident externally by two commodities being placed in such relation to each other, that the commodity whose value it is sought to express, figures directly as a mere use value, while the commodity in which that value is to be expressed, figures directly as mere exchange value. Hence the elementary form of value of a commodity is the elementary form in which the contrast contained in that commodity, between use value and value, becomes apparent.   ",Commodities
114,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Every product of labour is, in all states of society, a use value; but it is only at a definite historical epoch in a society’s development that such a product becomes a commodity, viz., at the epoch when the labour spent on the production of a useful article becomes expressed as one of the objective qualities of that article, i.e., as its value. It therefore follows that the elementary value form is also the primitive form under which a product of labour appears historically as a commodity, and that the gradual transformation of such products into commodities, proceeds pari passu with the development of the value form.   ",Commodities
115,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  We perceive, at first sight, the deficiencies of the elementary form of value: it is a mere germ, which must undergo a series of metamorphoses before it can ripen into the price form.   ",Commodities
116,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The expression of the value of commodity A in terms of any other commodity B, merely distinguishes the value from the use value of A, and therefore places A merely in a relation of exchange with a single different commodity, B; but it is still far from expressing A’s qualitative equality, and quantitative proportionality, to all commodities. To the elementary relative value form of a commodity, there corresponds the single equivalent form of one other commodity. Thus, in the relative expression of value of the linen, the coat assumes the form of equivalent, or of being directly exchangeable, only in relation to a single commodity, the linen.    ",Commodities
117,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Nevertheless, the elementary form of value passes by an easy transition into a more complete form. It is true that by means of the elementary form, the value of a commodity A, becomes expressed in terms of one, and only one, other commodity. But that one may be a commodity of any kind, coat, iron, corn, or anything else. Therefore, according as A is placed in relation with one or the other, we get for one and the same commodity, different elementary expressions of value. The number of such possible expressions is limited only by the number of the different kinds of commodities distinct from it. The isolated expression of A’s value, is therefore convertible into a series, prolonged to any length, of the different elementary expressions of that value.        ",Commodities

119,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The value of a single commodity, the linen, for example, is now expressed in terms of numberless other elements of the world of commodities. Every other commodity now becomes a mirror of the linen’s value. It is thus, that for the first time, this value shows itself in its true light as a congelation of undifferentiated human labour. For the labour that creates it, now stands expressly revealed, as labour that ranks equally with every other sort of human labour, no matter what its form, whether tailoring, ploughing, mining, &c., and no matter, therefore, whether it is realised in coats, corn, iron, or gold. The linen, by virtue of the form of its value, now stands in a social relation, no longer with only one other kind of commodity, but with the whole world of commodities. As a commodity, it is a citizen of that world. At the same time, the interminable series of value equations implies, that as regards the value of a commodity, it is a matter of indifference under what particular form, or kind, of use value it appears.   ",Commodities
120,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In the first form, 20 yds of linen = 1 coat, it might, for ought that otherwise appears, be pure accident, that these two commodities are exchangeable in definite quantities. In the second form, on the contrary, we perceive at once the background that determines, and is essentially different from, this accidental appearance. The value of the linen remains unaltered in magnitude, whether expressed in coats, coffee, or iron, or in numberless different commodities, the property of as many different owners. The accidental relation between two individual commodity-owners disappears. It becomes plain, that it is not the exchange of commodities which regulates the magnitude of their value; but, on the contrary, that it is the magnitude of their value which controls their exchange proportions.   ",Commodities
121,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Each commodity, such as, coat, tea, corn, iron, &c., figures in the expression of value of the linen, as an equivalent, and, consequently, as a thing that is value. The bodily form of each of these commodities figures now as a particular equivalent form, one out of many. In the same way the manifold concrete useful kinds of labour, embodied in these different commodities, rank now as so many different forms of the realisation, or manifestation, of undifferentiated human labour.  ",Commodities
122,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In the first place, the relative expression of value is incomplete because the series representing it is interminable. The chain of which each equation of value is a link, is liable at any moment to be lengthened by each new kind of commodity that comes into existence and furnishes the material for a fresh expression of value. In the second place, it is a many-coloured mosaic of disparate and independent expressions of value. And lastly, if, as must be the case, the relative value of each commodity in turn, becomes expressed in this expanded form, we get for each of them a relative value form, different in every case, and consisting of an interminable series of expressions of value. The defects of the expanded relative value form are reflected in the corresponding equivalent form. Since the bodily form of each single commodity is one particular equivalent form amongst numberless others, we have, on the whole, nothing but fragmentary equivalent forms, each excluding the others. In the same way, also, the special, concrete, useful kind of labour embodied in each particular equivalent, is presented only as a particular kind of labour, and therefore not as an exhaustive representative of human labour generally. The latter, indeed, gains adequate manifestation in the totality of its manifold, particular, concrete forms. But, in that case, its expression in an infinite series is ever incomplete and deficient in unity.   ",Commodities
123,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The expanded relative value form is, however, nothing but the sum of the elementary relative expressions or equations of the first kind, such as:  ",Commodities
124,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  20 yards of linen = 1 coat  20 yards of linen = 10 lbs of tea, etc.   ",Commodities
125,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Each of these implies the corresponding inverted equation,   ",Commodities
126,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  1 coat = 20 yards of linen   10 lbs of tea = 20 yards of linen, etc.   ",Commodities
127,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In fact, when a person exchanges his linen for many other commodities, and thus expresses its value in a series of other commodities, it necessarily follows, that the various owners of the latter exchange them for the linen, and consequently express the value of their various commodities in one and the same third commodity, the linen. If then, we reverse the series, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lbs of tea, etc., that is to say, if we give expression to the converse relation already implied in the series, we get,   ",Commodities
128,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  All commodities now express their value (1) in an elementary form, because in a single commodity; (2) with unity, because in one and the same commodity. This form of value is elementary and the same for all, therefore general.   ",Commodities
129,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  The forms A and B were fit only to express the value of a commodity as something distinct from its use value or material form.   ,Commodities
130,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The first form, A, furnishes such equations as the following:  – 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, 10 lbs of tea = ½ a ton of iron.    The value of the coat is equated to linen, that of the tea to iron. But to be equated to linen, and again to iron, is to be as different as are linen and iron. This form, it is plain, occurs practically only in the first beginning, when the products of labour are converted into commodities by accidental and occasional exchanges.   ",Commodities
131,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The second form, B, distinguishes, in a more adequate manner than the first, the value of a commodity from its use value, for the value of the coat is there placed in contrast under all possible shapes with the bodily form of the coat; it is equated to linen, to iron, to tea, in short, to everything else, only not to itself, the coat. On the other hand, any general expression of value common to all is directly excluded; for, in the equation of value of each commodity, all other commodities now appear only under the form of equivalents. The expanded form of value comes into actual existence for the first time so soon as a particular product of labour, such as cattle, is no longer exceptionally, but habitually, exchanged for various other commodities.   ",Commodities
132,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The third and lastly developed form expresses the values of the whole world of commodities in terms of a single commodity set apart for the purpose, namely, the linen, and thus represents to us their values by means of their equality with linen. The value of every commodity is now, by being equated to linen, not only differentiated from its own use value, but from all other use values generally, and is, by that very fact, expressed as that which is common to all commodities. By this form, commodities are, for the first time, effectively brought into relation with one another as values, or made to appear as exchange values.   ",Commodities
133,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The two earlier forms either express the value of each commodity in terms of a single commodity of a different kind, or in a series of many such commodities. In both cases, it is, so to say, the special business of each single commodity to find an expression for its value, and this it does without the help of the others. These others, with respect to the former, play the passive parts of equivalents. The general form of value, C, results from the joint action of the whole world of commodities, and from that alone. A commodity can acquire a general expression of its value only by all other commodities, simultaneously with it, expressing their values in the same equivalent; and every new commodity must follow suit. It thus becomes evident that since the existence of commodities as values is purely social, this social existence can be expressed by the totality of their social relations alone, and consequently that the form of their value must be a socially recognised form.   ",Commodities
134,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  All commodities being equated to linen now appear not only as qualitatively equal as values generally, but also as values whose magnitudes are capable of comparison. By expressing the magnitudes of their values in one and the same material, the linen, those magnitudes are also compared with each other. For instance, 10 lbs of tea = 20 yards of linen, and 40 lbs of coffee = 20 yards of linen. Therefore, 10 lbs of tea = 40 lbs of coffee. In other words, there is contained in 1 lb of coffee only one-fourth as much substance of value – labour – as is contained in 1 lb of tea.   ",Commodities
135,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The general form of relative value, embracing the whole world of commodities, converts the single commodity that is excluded from the rest, and made to play the part of equivalent – here the linen – into the universal equivalent. The bodily form of the linen is now the form assumed in common by the values of all commodities; it therefore becomes directly exchangeable with all and every of them. The substance linen becomes the visible incarnation, the social chrysalis state of every kind of human labour. Weaving, which is the labour of certain private individuals producing a particular article, linen, acquires in consequence a social character, the character of equality with all other kinds of labour. The innumerable equations of which the general form of value is composed, equate in turn the labour embodied in the linen to that embodied in every other commodity, and they thus convert weaving into the general form of manifestation of undifferentiated human labour. In this manner the labour realised in the values of commodities is presented not only under its negative aspect, under which abstraction is made from every concrete form and useful property of actual work, but its own positive nature is made to reveal itself expressly. The general value form is the reduction of all kinds of actual labour to their common character of being human labour generally, of being the expenditure of human labour power.   ",Commodities
136,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The general value form, which represents all products of labour as mere congelations of undifferentiated human labour, shows by its very structure that it is the social resumé of the world of commodities. That form consequently makes it indisputably evident that in the world of commodities the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its specific social character.      ",Commodities
137,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,  The degree of development of the relative form of value corresponds to that of the equivalent form. But we must bear in mind that the development of the latter is only the expression and result of the development of the former.   ,Commodities
138,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The primary or isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts some other commodity into an isolated equivalent. The expanded form of relative value, which is the expression of the value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities, endows those other commodities with the character of particular equivalents differing in kind. And lastly, a particular kind of commodity acquires the character of universal equivalent, because all other commodities make it the material in which they uniformly express their value.   ",Commodities
139,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form, the two poles of the value form, is developed concurrently with that form itself.   ",Commodities
140,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The first form, 20 yds of linen = one coat, already contains this antagonism, without as yet fixing it. According as we read this equation forwards or backwards, the parts played by the linen and the coat are different. In the one case the relative value of the linen is expressed in the coat, in the other case the relative value of the coat is expressed in the linen. In this first form of value, therefore, it is difficult to grasp the polar contrast.   ",Commodities
141,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Form B shows that only one single commodity at a time can completely expand its relative value, and that it acquires this expanded form only because, and in so far as, all other commodities are, with respect to it, equivalents. Here we cannot reverse the equation, as we can the equation 20 yds of linen = 1 coat, without altering its general character, and converting it from the expanded form of value into the general form of value.    ",Commodities
142,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Finally, the form C gives to the world of commodities a general social relative form of value, because, and in so far as, thereby all commodities, with the exception of one, are excluded from the equivalent form. A single commodity, the linen, appears therefore to have acquired the character of direct exchangeability with every other commodity because, and in so far as, this character is denied to every other commodity.  ",Commodities
143,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The commodity that figures as universal equivalent, is, on the other hand, excluded from the relative value form. If the linen, or any other commodity serving as universal equivalent, were, at the same time, to share in the relative form of value, it would have to serve as its own equivalent. We should then have 20 yds of linen = 20 yds of linen; this tautology expresses neither value, nor magnitude of value. In order to express the relative value of the universal equivalent, we must rather reverse the form C. This equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other commodities, but its value is relatively expressed by a never ending series of other commodities.    Thus, the expanded form of relative value, or form B, now shows itself as the specific form of relative value for the equivalent commodity.      ",Commodities
144,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The universal equivalent form is a form of value in general. It can, therefore, be assumed by any commodity. On the other hand, if a commodity be found to have assumed the universal equivalent form (form C), this is only because and in so far as it has been excluded from the rest of all other commodities as their equivalent, and that by their own act. And from the moment that this exclusion becomes finally restricted to one particular commodity, from that moment only, the general form of relative value of the world of commodities obtains real consistence and general social validity.   ",Commodities
145,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The particular commodity, with whose bodily form the equivalent form is thus socially identified, now becomes the money commodity, or serves as money. It becomes the special social function of that commodity, and consequently its social monopoly, to play within the world of commodities the part of the universal equivalent. Amongst the commodities which, in form B, figure as particular equivalents of the linen, and, in form C, express in common their relative values in linen, this foremost place has been attained by one in particular – namely, gold. If, then, in form C we replace the linen by gold, we get,      ",Commodities
147,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  In passing from form A to form B, and from the latter to form C, the changes are fundamental. On the other hand, there is no difference between forms C and D, except that, in the latter, gold has assumed the equivalent form in the place of linen. Gold is in form D, what linen was in form C – the universal equivalent. The progress consists in this alone, that the character of direct and universal exchangeability – in other words, that the universal equivalent form – has now, by social custom, become finally identified with the substance, gold.   ",Commodities
148,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it was previously, with reference to them, a simple commodity. Like all other commodities, it was also capable of serving as an equivalent, either as simple equivalent in isolated exchanges, or as particular equivalent by the side of others. Gradually it began to serve, within varying limits, as universal equivalent. So soon as it monopolises this position in the expression of value for the world of commodities, it becomes the money commodity, and then, and not till then, does form D become distinct from form C, and the general form of value become changed into the money form.   ",Commodities
149,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The elementary expression of the relative value of a single commodity, such as linen, in terms of the commodity, such as gold, that plays the part of money, is the price form of that commodity. The price form of the linen is therefore   ",Commodities
150,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold, or, if 2 ounces of gold when  coined are £2, 20 yards of linen = £2.   ",Commodities
151,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The difficulty in forming a concept of the money form, consists in clearly comprehending the universal equivalent form, and as a necessary corollary, the general form of value, form C. The latter is deducible from form B, the expanded form of value, the essential component element of which, we saw, is form A, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or x commodity A = y commodity B. The simple commodity form is therefore the germ of the money form.   ",Commodities
154,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood. Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties. So far as it is a value in use, there is nothing mysterious about it, whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants, or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour. It is as clear as noon-day, that man, by his industry, changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature, in such a way as to make them useful to him. The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common, every-day thing, wood. But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is changed into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than “table-turning” ever was.    ",Commodities
155,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The mystical character of commodities does not originate, therefore, in their use value. Just as little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value. For, in the first place, however varied the useful kinds of labour, or productive activities, may be, it is a physiological fact, that they are functions of the human organism, and that each such function, whatever may be its nature or form, is essentially the expenditure of human brain, nerves, muscles, &c. Secondly, with regard to that which forms the ground-work for the quantitative determination of value, namely, the duration of that expenditure, or the quantity of labour, it is quite clear that there is a palpable difference between its quantity and quality. In all states of society, the labour time that it costs to produce the means of subsistence, must necessarily be an object of interest to mankind, though not of equal interest in different stages of development. And lastly, from the moment that men in any way work for one another, their labour assumes a social form.   ",Commodities
156,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Whence, then, arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour, so soon as it assumes the form of commodities? Clearly from this form itself. The equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values; the measure of the expenditure of labour power by the duration of that expenditure, takes the form of the quantity of value of the products of labour; and finally the mutual relations of the producers, within which the social character of their labour affirms itself, take the form of a social relation between the products.   ",Commodities
157,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it the social character of men’s labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour; because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation, existing not between themselves, but between the products of their labour. This is the reason why the products of labour become commodities, social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses. In the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve, but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself. But, in the act of seeing, there is at all events, an actual passage of light from one thing to another, from the external object to the eye. There is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities. There, the existence of the things quâ commodities, and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom.  There it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men’s hands. This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour, so soon as they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.   ",Commodities
158,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  This Fetishism of commodities has its origin, as the foregoing analysis has already shown, in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces them.   ",Commodities
159,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  As a general rule, articles of utility become commodities, only because they are products of the labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of each other. The sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labour of society. Since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products, the specific social character of each producer’s labour does not show itself except in the act of exchange. In other words, the labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society, only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes directly between the products, and indirectly, through them, between the producers. To the latter, therefore, the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear, not as direct social relations between individuals at work, but as what they really are, material relations between persons and social relations between things. It is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire, as values, one uniform social status, distinct from their varied forms of existence as objects of utility. This division of a product into a useful thing and a value becomes practically important, only when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful articles are produced for the purpose of being exchanged, and their character as values has therefore to be taken into account, beforehand, during production. From this moment the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a two-fold character. On the one hand, it must, as a definite useful kind of labour, satisfy a definite social want, and thus hold its place as part and parcel of the collective labour of all, as a branch of a social division of labour that has sprung up spontaneously. On the other hand, it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual producer himself, only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an established social fact, and therefore the private useful labour of each producer ranks on an equality with that of all others. The equalisation of the most different kinds of labour can be the result only of an abstraction from their inequalities, or of reducing them to their common denominator, viz. expenditure of human labour power or human labour in the abstract. The two-fold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him, when reflected in his brain, only under those forms which are impressed upon that labour in every-day practice by the exchange of products. In this way, the character that his own labour possesses of being socially useful takes the form of the condition, that the product must be not only useful, but useful for others, and the social character that his particular labour has of being the equal of all other particular kinds of labour, takes the form that all the physically different articles that are the products of labour, have one common quality, viz., that of having value.    ",Commodities
160,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Hence, when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values, it is not because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour. Quite the contrary: whenever, by an exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very act, we also equate, as human labour, the different kinds of labour expended upon them. We are not aware of this, nevertheless we do it. Value, therefore, does not stalk about with a label describing what it is. It is value, rather, that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, we try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of our own social products; for to stamp an object of utility as a value, is just as much a social product as language. The recent scientific discovery, that the products of labour, so far as they are values, are but material expressions of the human labour spent in their production, marks, indeed, an epoch in the history of the development of the human race, but, by no means, dissipates the mist through which the social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves. The fact, that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing, viz., the production of commodities, the specific social character of private labour carried on independently, consists in the equality of every kind of that labour, by virtue of its being human labour, which character, therefore, assumes in the product the form of value – this fact appears to the producers, notwithstanding the discovery above referred to, to be just as real and final, as the fact, that, after the discovery by science of the component gases of air, the atmosphere itself remained unaltered.    ",Commodities
161,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  What, first of all, practically concerns producers when they make an exchange, is the question, how much of some other product they get for their own? In what proportions the products are exchangeable? When these proportions have, by custom, attained a certain stability, they appear to result from the nature of the products, so that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of their different physical and chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight. The character of having value, when once impressed upon products, obtains fixity only by reason of their acting and re-acting upon each other as quantities of value. These quantities vary continually, independently of the will, foresight and action of the producers. To them, their own social action takes the form of the action of objects, which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them. It requires a fully developed production of commodities before, from accumulated experience alone, the scientific conviction springs up, that all the different kinds of private labour, which are carried on independently of each other, and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the social division of labour, are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society requires them. And why? Because, in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations between the products, the labour time socially necessary for their production forcibly asserts itself like an over-riding law of Nature. The law of gravity thus asserts itself when a house falls about our ears. The determination of the magnitude of value by labour time is therefore a secret, hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of commodities. Its discovery, while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the determination of the magnitude of the values of products, yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination takes place.   ",Commodities
162,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Man’s reflections on the forms of social life, and consequently, also, his scientific analysis of those forms, take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development. He begins, post festum, with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him. The characters that stamp products as commodities, and whose establishment is a necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities, have already acquired the stability of natural, self-understood forms of social life, before man seeks to decipher, not their historical character, for in his eyes they are immutable, but their meaning. Consequently it was the analysis of the prices of commodities that alone led to the determination of the magnitude of value, and it was the common expression of all commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their characters as values. It is, however, just this ultimate money form of the world of commodities that actually conceals, instead of disclosing, the social character of private labour, and the social relations between the individual producers. When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation to linen, because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour, the absurdity of the statement is self-evident. Nevertheless, when the producers of coats and boots compare those articles with linen, or, what is the same thing, with gold or silver, as the universal equivalent, they express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in the same absurd form.   ",Commodities
163,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. They are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.    ",Commodities
164,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Since Robinson Crusoe’s experiences are a favourite theme with political economists, let us take a look at him on his island. Moderate though he be, yet some few wants he has to satisfy, and must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts, such as making tools and furniture, taming goats, fishing and hunting. Of his prayers and the like we take no account, since they are a source of pleasure to him, and he looks upon them as so much recreation. In spite of the variety of his work, he knows that his labour, whatever its form, is but the activity of one and the same Robinson, and consequently, that it consists of nothing but different modes of human labour. Necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds of work. Whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another, depends on the difficulties, greater or less as the case may be, to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed at. This our friend Robinson soon learns by experience, and having rescued a watch, ledger, and pen and ink from the wreck, commences, like a true-born Briton, to keep a set of books. His stock-book contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him, of the operations necessary for their production; and lastly, of the labour time that definite quantities of those objects have, on an average, cost him. All the relations between Robinson and the objects that form this wealth of his own creation, are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion, even to Mr. Sedley Taylor. And yet those relations contain all that is essential to the determination of value.   ",Commodities
165,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Let us now transport ourselves from Robinson’s island bathed in light to the European middle ages shrouded in darkness. Here, instead of the independent man, we find everyone dependent, serfs and lords, vassals and suzerains, laymen and clergy. Personal dependence here characterises the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life organised on the basis of that production. But for the very reason that personal dependence forms the ground-work of society, there is no necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different from their reality. They take the shape, in the transactions of society, of services in kind and payments in kind. Here the particular and natural form of labour, and not, as in a society based on production of commodities, its general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour. Compulsory labour is just as properly measured by time, as commodity-producing labour; but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord, is a definite quantity of his own personal labour power. The tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing. No matter, then, what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people themselves in this society, the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour, appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations, and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labour.    ",Commodities
166,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  For an example of labour in common or directly associated labour, we have no occasion to go back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all civilised races. We have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family, that produces corn, cattle, yarn, linen, and clothing for home use. These different articles are, as regards the family, so many products of its labour, but as between themselves, they are not commodities. The different kinds of labour, such as tillage, cattle tending, spinning, weaving and making clothes, which result in the various products, are in themselves, and such as they are, direct social functions, because functions of the family, which, just as much as a society based on the production of commodities, possesses a spontaneously developed system of division of labour. The distribution of the work within the family, and the regulation of the labour time of the several members, depend as well upon differences of age and sex as upon natural conditions varying with the seasons. The labour power of each individual, by its very nature, operates in this case merely as a definite portion of the whole labour power of the family, and therefore, the measure of the expenditure of individual labour power by its duration, appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour.   ",Commodities
167,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  Let us now picture to ourselves, by way of change, a community of free individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in common, in which the labour power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community. All the characteristics of Robinson’s labour are here repeated, but with this difference, that they are social, instead of individual. Everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own personal labour, and therefore simply an object of use for himself. The total product of our community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social. But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence. A distribution of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary. The mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community, and the degree of historical development attained by the producers. We will assume, but merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities, that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his labour time. Labour time would, in that case, play a double part. Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community. On the other hand, it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual, and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption. The social relations of the individual producers, with regard both to their labour and to its products, are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution.   ",Commodities
168,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The religious world is but the reflex of the real world. And for a society based upon the production of commodities, in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values, whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour – for such a society, Christianity with its cultus of abstract man, more especially in its bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism, &c., is the most fitting form of religion. In the ancient Asiatic and other ancient modes of production, we find that the conversion of products into commodities, and therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities, holds a subordinate place, which, however, increases in importance as the primitive communities approach nearer and nearer to their dissolution. Trading nations, properly so called, exist in the ancient world only in its interstices, like the gods of Epicurus in the Intermundia, or like Jews in the pores of Polish society. Those ancient social organisms of production are, as compared with bourgeois society, extremely simple and transparent. But they are founded either on the immature development of man individually, who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen in a primitive tribal community, or upon direct relations of subjection. They can arise and exist only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage, and when, therefore, the social relations within the sphere of material life, between man and man, and between man and Nature, are correspondingly narrow. This narrowness is reflected in the ancient worship of Nature, and in the other elements of the popular religions. The religious reflex of the real world can, in any case, only then finally vanish, when the practical relations of every-day life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his fellowmen and to Nature.   ",Commodities
169,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The life-process of society, which is based on the process of material production, does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men, and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan. This, however, demands for society a certain material ground-work or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development.

Since exchange value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed upon an object, Nature has no more to do with it, than it has in fixing the course of exchange.   ",Commodities
172,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  The mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity, or is produced directly for exchange, is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois production. It therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history, though not in the same predominating and characteristic manner as now-a-days. Hence its Fetish character is comparatively easy to be seen through. But when we come to more concrete forms, even this appearance of simplicity vanishes. Whence arose the illusions of the monetary system? To it gold and silver, when serving as money, did not represent a social relation between producers, but were natural objects with strange social properties. And modern economy, which looks down with such disdain on the monetary system, does not its superstition come out as clear as noon-day, whenever it treats of capital? How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion, that rents grow out of the soil and not out of society?       ",Commodities
173,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm,"  But not to anticipate, we will content ourselves with yet another example relating to the commodity form. Could commodities themselves speak, they would say: Our use value may be a thing that interests men. It is no part of us as objects. What, however, does belong to us as objects, is our value. Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it. In the eyes of each other we are nothing but exchange values. Now listen how those commodities speak through the mouth of the economist.",Commodities

The economic discoverers of this chemical element, who by-the-bye lay special claim to critical acumen, find however that the use value of objects belongs to them independently of their material properties, while their value, on the other hand, forms a part of them as objects. What confirms them in this view, is the peculiar circumstance that the use value of objects is realised without exchange, by means of a direct relation between the objects and man, while, on the other hand, their value is realised only by exchange, that is, by means of a social process.

In order to prove that labour alone is that all-sufficient and real measure, by which at all times the value of all commodities can be estimated and compared, Adam Smith says, “Equal quantities of labour must at all times and in all places have the same value for the labourer. In his normal state of health, strength, and activity, and with the average degree of skill that he may possess, he must always give up the same portion of his rest, his freedom, and his happiness.” (“Wealth of Nations,” b. I. ch. V.) On the one hand Adam Smith here (but not everywhere) confuses the determination of value by means of the quantity of labour expended in the production of commodities, with the determination of the values of commodities by means of the value of labour, and seeks in consequence to prove that equal quantities of labour have always the same value. On the other hand he has a presentiment, that labour, so far as it manifests itself in the value of commodities, counts only as expenditure of labour power, but he treats this expenditure as the mere sacrifice of rest, freedom, and happiness, not as at the same time the normal activity of living beings. But then, he has the modern wage-labourer in his eye. Much more aptly, the anonymous predecessor of Adam Smith, quoted above in Note 1, p. 39   ",Commodities

Franklin, &c.,” edited by Sparks. Boston, 1836, Vol. II., p. 267.) Franklin is unconscious that by estimating the value of everything in labour, he makes abstraction from any difference in the sorts of labour exchanged, and thus reduces them all to equal human labour.

Every such expression tells us, that what appears in the use values, coat, corn, &c., is the value of the linen. “The value of any commodity denoting its relation in exchange, we may speak of it as ... corn value, cloth value, according to the commodity with which it is compared; and hence there are a thousand different kinds of value, as many kinds of value as there are commodities in existence, and all are equally real and equally nominal.” (“A Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measures and Causes of Value: chiefly in reference to the writings of Mr. Ricardo and his followers.” By the author of “Essays on the Formation, &c., of Opinions.” London, 1825, p. 39.) S. Bailey, the author of this anonymous work, a work which in its day created much stir in England, fancied that, by thus pointing out the various relative expressions of one and the same value, he had proved the impossibility of any determination of the concept of value. However narrow his own views may have been, yet, that he laid his finger on some serious defects in the Ricardian Theory, is proved by the animosity with which he was attacked by Ricardo’s followers. See the Westminster Review for example.  ",Commodities

It is by no means self-evident that this character of direct and universal exchangeability is, so to speak, a polar one, and as intimately connected with its opposite pole, the absence of direct exchangeability, as the positive pole of the magnet is with its negative counterpart. It may therefore be imagined that all commodities can simultaneously have this character impressed upon them, just as it can be imagined that all Catholics can be popes together. It is, of course, highly desirable in the eyes of the petit bourgeois, for whom the production of commodities is the nec plus ultra of human freedom and individual independence, that the inconveniences resulting from this character of commodities not being directly exchangeable, should be removed. Proudhon’s socialism is a working out of this Philistine Utopia, a form of socialism which, as I have elsewhere shown, does not possess even the merit of originality. Long before his time, the task was attempted with much better success by Gray, Bray, and others. But, for all that, wisdom of this kind flourishes even now in certain circles under the name of “science.” Never has any school played more tricks with the word science, than that of Proudhon, for “wo Begriffe fehlen, Da stellt zur rechten Zeit ein Wort sich ein.”   ",Commodities

At that time, spiritualism, especially table-turning, became the rage among the European aristocracy. In 1850-64, China was swept by an anti-feudal liberation movement in the form of a large-scale peasant war, the Taiping Revolt. – Note by editors of MECW.  ",Commodities

A more exhaustive study of Asiatic, and especially of Indian forms of common property, would show how from the different forms of primitive common property, different forms of its dissolution have been developed.

The insufficiency of Ricardo’s analysis of the magnitude of value, and his analysis is by far the best, will appear from the 3rd and 4th books of this work. As regards value in general, it is the weak point of the classical school of Political Economy that it nowhere expressly and with full consciousness, distinguishes between labour, as it appears in the value of a product, and the same labour, as it appears in the use value of that product. Of course the distinction is practically made, since this school treats labour, at one time under its quantitative aspect, at another under its qualitative aspect. But it has not the least idea, that when the difference between various kinds of labour is treated as purely quantitative, their qualitative unity or equality, and therefore their reduction to abstract human labour, is implied. For instance, Ricardo declares that he agrees with Destutt de Tracy in this proposition: “As it is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches, the employment of those faculties, labour of some kind, is our only original treasure, and it is always from this employment that all those things are created which we call riches... It is certain, too, that all those things only represent the labour which has created them, and if they have a value, or even two distinct values, they can only derive them from that (the value) of the labour from which they emanate.” (Ricardo, “The Principles of Pol. Econ.,” 3 Ed. Lond. 1821, p. 334.) We would here only point out, that Ricardo puts his own more profound interpretation upon the words of Destutt. What the latter really says is, that on the one hand all things which constitute wealth represent the labour that creates them, but that on the other hand, they acquire their “two different values” (use value and exchange value) from “the value of labour.” He thus falls into the commonplace error of the vulgar economists, who assume the value of one commodity (in this case labour) in order to determine the values of the rest. But Ricardo reads him as if he had said, that labour (not the value of labour) is embodied both in use value and exchange value. Nevertheless, Ricardo himself pays so little attention to the two-fold character of the labour which has a two-fold embodiment, that he devotes the whole of his chapter on “Value and Riches, Their Distinctive Properties,” to a laborious examination of the trivialities of a J.B. Say. And at the finish he is quite astonished to find that Destutt on the one hand agrees with him as to labour being the source of value, and on the other hand with J. B. Say as to the notion of value.  ",Commodities

It is one of the chief failings of classical economy that it has never succeeded, by means of its analysis of commodities, and, in particular, of their value, in discovering that form under which value becomes exchange value. Even Adam Smith and Ricardo, the best representatives of the school, treat the form of value as a thing of no importance, as having no connection with the inherent nature of commodities. The reason for this is not solely because their attention is entirely absorbed in the analysis of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The value form of the product of labour is not only the most abstract, but is also the most universal form, taken by the product in bourgeois production, and stamps that production as a particular species of social production, and thereby gives it its special historical character. If then we treat this mode of production as one eternally fixed by Nature for every state of society, we necessarily overlook that which is the differentia specifica of the value form, and consequently of the commodity form, and of its further developments, money form, capital form, &c. We consequently find that economists, who are thoroughly agreed as to labour time being the measure of the magnitude of value, have the most strange and contradictory ideas of money, the perfected form of the general equivalent. This is seen in a striking manner when they treat of banking, where the commonplace definitions of money will no longer hold water. This led to the rise of a restored mercantile system (Ganilh, &c.), which sees in value nothing but a social form, or rather the unsubstantial ghost of that form. Once for all I may here state, that by classical Political Economy, I understand that economy which, since the time of W. Petty, has investigated the real relations of production in bourgeois society in contradistinction to vulgar economy, which deals with appearances only, ruminates without ceasing on the materials long since provided by scientific economy, and there seeks plausible explanations of the most obtrusive phenomena, for bourgeois daily use, but for the rest, confines itself to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlasting truths, the trite ideas held by the self-complacent bourgeoisie with regard to their own world, to them the best of all possible worlds.

Il n’y a pour eux que deux sortes d’institutions, celles de l’art et celles de la nature. Les institutions de la féodalité sont des institutions artificielles celles de la bourgeoisie sont des institutions naturelles. Ils ressemblent en ceci aux théologiens, qui eux aussi établissent deux sortes de religions. Toute religion qui n’est pas la leur, est une invention des hommes tandis que leur propre religion est une émanation de Dieu—Ainsi il y a eu de l’histoire, mais il n’y en a plus.”  ( Misère de la Philosophie. Réponse a la Philosophie de la Misère par M. Proudhon, 1847, p. 113.) Truly comical is M. Bastiat, who imagines that the ancient Greeks and Romans lived by plunder alone. But when people plunder for centuries, there must always be something at hand for them to seize; the objects of plunder must be continually reproduced. It would thus appear that even Greeks and Romans had some process of production, consequently, an economy, which just as much constituted the material basis of their world, as bourgeois economy constitutes that of our modern world. Or perhaps Bastiat means, that a mode of production based on slavery is based on a system of plunder. In that case he treads on dangerous ground. If a giant thinker like Aristotle erred in his appreciation of slave labour, why should a dwarf economist like Bastiat be right in his appreciation of wage labour? I seize this opportunity of shortly answering an objection taken by a German paper in America, to my work, “Zur Kritik der Pol. Oekonomie, 1859.” In the estimation of that paper, my view that each special mode of production and the social relations corresponding to it, in short, that the economic structure of society, is the real basis on which the juridical and political superstructure is raised and to which definite social forms of thought correspond; that the mode of production determines the character of the social, political, and intellectual life generally, all this is very true for our own times, in which material interests preponderate, but not for the middle ages, in which Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome, where politics, reigned supreme. In the first place it strikes one as an odd thing for any one to suppose that these well-worn phrases about the middle ages and the ancient world are unknown to anyone else. This much, however, is clear, that the middle ages could not live on Catholicism, nor the ancient world on politics. On the contrary, it is the mode in which they gained a livelihood that explains why here politics, and there Catholicism, played the chief part. For the rest, it requires but a slight acquaintance with the history of the Roman republic, for example, to be aware that its secret history is the history of its landed property. On the other hand, Don Quixote long ago paid the penalty for wrongly imagining that knight errantry was compatible with all economic forms of society.  ",Commodities

Precisely how this reduction is to be controlled is not relevant here. That this reduction is constantly occurring is revealed by experience.

The productive power of labour is determined by manifold conditions, among others by the average grade of competence of the workers, the level of development of science and its technological applicability, the social combination of the process of production, the scope and the efficacy of the means of production, and by natural relationships. The same quantum of labour manifests itself after propitious weather in 8 bushels of wheat, but after impropitious weather, in only 4, for example. The very same quantum of labour provides more metals in richly laden mines than in poor ones, etc. Diamonds are rare on the surface of the earth, and their discovery therefore costs on the average much labour-time. Consequently, they represent much labour in a small volume of space. Jacob doubts that gold has ever paid its complete value. This holds true even more for diamonds. According to Eschwege, by 1823 the complete yield of the eight-year old Brazilian diamond-diggings had not yet amounted to the value of the 1½ year average product of the Brazilian sugar or coffee plantations. Given more richly laden diggings the same quantum of labour would be represented by more diamonds and their value would sink. If one succeeds in converting coal into diamonds with little labour, then the value of diamonds would sink beneath that of paving stones. In general: the greater the productive power of labour the smaller is the amount of labour-time required for the production of an article, and the smaller the mass of labour crystallized in it, the smaller is its value. And on the contrary, the smaller the productive power of labour, the greater is the labour-time necessary for the-production of an article, and the greater its value is.

In the community of ancient India, labour is socially divided without the products becoming commodities. Or a more immediate example, in every factory labour is systematically divided, but this division is not thereby mediated by the fact that the workers exchange their individual products. Only products of those deployments of private labour which are self-sufficient and independent of one another confront one another as commodities. So we have observed the following – that a particular purposefully productive activity or useful labour lurks in the use-value of every commodity. Use-values cannot confront one another as commodities unless deployments of qualitatively different useful labour lurk in them. In a society whose products generally assume the form of commodity (i.e., in a society of commodity producers) this qualitative difference in the deployments of useful labour which are carried on independently of one another as the private businesses of self-sufficient producers develops into a multi-faceted system – to a social division of labour.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition
246,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"It is a matter of indifference, in any case, to the coat whether it is worn by the tailor or one of his customers. In both cases it acts as a use-value. Just as little, is the relationship between the coat and the labour which produced it changed in and for itself by virtue of the fact that tailoring is a profession in itself – an independent member of the social division of labour. Where a need for clothing compelled him, man plied the activity of tailor for whole millenia before he became a tailor instead of a man. But the reality of coat, linen, and every element of material wealth which is not given by nature in all cases had to be mediated by a special, purposely productive activity which assimilates particular natural entities to human needs. As the former of use-values, as useful labour, labour is thereby the precondition of existence for man – independent of all social forms – and an eternal necessity of nature for the sake of mediating the material interchange between man and nature (i.e., human life).",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition
247,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"The use-values coat, linen, etc. – in brief, the commodity-bodies – are connections of two elements, natural matter and labour. If one subtracts the total sum of all different instances of useful labour which lurk inside the coat, linen, etc., there always remains a material substrate left over which is present naturally without the interference of man. Man can only proceed in his producing like nature does herself; i.e., only change the forms of material. And what is more, in this labour of formation itself he is constantly supported by natural forces. Labour is not, therefore, the only source of those use-values which are produced by it – material wealth. Labour is its father, as William Petty says, and the earth is its mother.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

249,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"According to our assumption the coat has double the value of linen. This, however, is only a quantitative difference, which is not yet of immediate interest to us. We recall, therefore, that if the value of a coat is twice as great as that of 10 yards of linen, then 20 yards of linen have the same amount of value as a coat. As values, a coat and linen are things of equal substance, objective expressions of similar labour. But tailoring and weaving are qualitatively different kinds of labour. Conditions of society, however, are found, wherein the very same person alternately tailors and weaves; and both these modes of labouring are therefore merely modifications of the labour of one and the same individual, and are not yet specific definite functions of different individuals: just as the coat which our tailor makes today, and the trousers which he is to make tomorrow only presuppose variations of the same individual labour. Appearance itself teaches, moreover, that in our capitalistic society a given portion of human labour is adduced alternately in the form of tailoring or in the form of weaving on each occasion in accordance with the shifting direction of the demand for labour. This changing of form which labour endures may occur not without friction – but it must occur. If one disregards the determinacy of productive activity and therefore disregards the useful character of labour, it remains true about it that it is an expenditure of human labour power. The labour of a tailor and weaving, although they are qualitatively different productive activities, are both productive expenditure of human brain, muscle, nerve, hand, etc., and are both in this sense human labour. They are merely two different forms of expending human labour power.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

The value of the commodities, however, represents human labour in the simplest form, the expenditure of human labour power in general. Now just as a general or a banker plays a big role in bourgeois society but the simple human being, on the other hand, plays a very shabby role, that is the way things stand here also in the case of human labour. It is the expenditure of simple labour power, which every normal human being possesses in his bodily organism, quite apart from any special elaboration.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

Just as the use-values coat and linen are connections of purposeful productive activities with cloth and yarn, whereas the values, coat and linen, on the other hand, are mere labour-precipitates of a similar species, just so does also the labour contained in these values count not on account of its productive relationship to cloth and yarn but only as expenditure of human labour-power. Tailoring and weaving are formative elements of the use-values coat and linen precisely by virtue of their different qualities; but they are only the substance of coat-value and linen-value insofar as there is an abstracting from their specific quality and both possess the same quality, the quality of human labour. Coat and linen, however, are not only values in general, but are values of definite magnitude and in accordance with our assumption the coat is worth twice as much as 10 yards of linen. What is the origin of this difference in their magnitudes of value? It is the fact that linen contains only half as much labour as the coat, so that labour power has to be expended for a period of twice the time taken for the production of the latter as for the production of the former.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

In the former case, what is at issue is the how and what of labour; and in the latter case, what matters is its how much, its temporal duration.

If one coat represents x days of labour, then two coats represent 2x days of labour, etc. But now assume that the labour-time necessary for the production of a coat rises to twice as much, or falls to half as much. In the first instance, a coat has as much value as two coats had previously; and in the latter case, two coats have only just so much value as previously one had, although in both cases a coat performs the same tasks as before and the useful labour contained in it remains of the same beneficence as before.

With two coats two human beings can be clad, and with one coat only one human being, etc. Nevertheless, a fall in the magnitude of value of material wealth may correspond contemporaneously to a rise in its mass. This contrary motion is produced by the two-sided specification of labour. Productive power is naturally always productive power of useful, concrete labour. Actually, it only expresses the level of efficacy of purposeful activity in a given extension of time. Useful labour becomes, therefore, a richer or poorer source of products in direct relationship to the rising or falling of its productive power. A change in the productive power, on the other hand, has in and for itself no effect whatsoever upon the labour represented in the value. Since the productive power belongs to the concrete, useful form of labour, it can naturally no longer influence labour, as soon as there is an abstracting from its concrete useful form. The very same labour, therefore, when it is represented in the same extensions of time, is also on all occasions represented in the same magnitude of value – however much the productive power may change. But it yields differing quanta of use values, within the same extension of time: more whenever the productive power rises; less, whenever it sinks. In the first case, it can happen that two coats contain less labour than one did previously. The very same change in productive power, which increases the fruitfulness of labour and hence the mass of use-values yielded by it, can therefore diminish the magnitude of value even of the increased total mass – namely whenever it shortens the labour-time necessary for its production.

Its stiff-as-linen corporeality or natural form is consequently not its form of value, but its direct opposite. It reveals its own reality as value immediately by relating itself to another commodity (the coat) as equal to itself. If it were not itself value, then it could not relate itself to coat (as value) as its own sort of thing. It posits itself as qualitatively equal to the coat, by relating itself to it as objectification of human labour of the same species, i.e., of its own value-substance; and it posits itself as equal to only one coat instead of x coats, because it is not just value in general, but value of a specific magnitude – and a coat, however, contains precisely just so much labour as 20 yards of linen. By this relationship to the coat, linen swats different flies with one stroke. By equating the other commodity to itself as value, it relates itself to itself as value. By relating itself to itself as value, it distinguishes itself from itself as use-value, at the same time. By expressing its magnitude of value in the coat (and magnitude of value is both things: value in general, and quantitatively measured value), it endows its reality as value with a form of value which differs from its immediate existence. By revealing itself in this manner as a thing which is differentiated within itself, it reveals itself for the first time really as a commodity – a useful thing which is at the same time value. Insofar as linen is use-value, it is an independent thing. Its value appears, on the other hand only in relationship to another commodity (e.g., the coat), which a coat is, is qualitatively equated to it (the linen), and consequently in some specific quantity counts as equivalent to it, replaces it and is exchangeable for it.

In so far as labour is detectable in it (and not every embodiment of commodity reveals the trace of labour), it is not some undifferentiated human labour, but rather: weaving, spinning, etc. – which, in addition, are by no means the only components of its substance but of course are leavened with matter derived from nature. In order to retain linen as a merely corporeal expression of human labour one has to abstract from all that which makes it to be really a thing. Any objectivity of human labour which is itself abstract (i.e., without any additional quality and content) is necessarily an abstract objectivity – a thing of thought. In that fashion, a web of flax turns into a chimera. But commodities are objects. They have to be what they are in an object-like way or else reveal it in their own object-like relationships. In the production of linen, a particular quantum of human labour exists in having been expended. The linen’s value is the merely objective reflection of the labour so expended, but it is not reflected in the body of the linen. It reveals itself (i.e., acquires a sensual expression) by its value-relationship to the coat. By the linen’s equating the coat to itself as value – while at the same time distinguishing itself from the coat as object of use – what happens is that the coat becomes the form of appearance of linen-value as opposed to linen-body: its value-form as distinguished from its natural form.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

The use-value coat only becomes the form of appearance of linen-value because linen relates itself to the material of the coat as to an immediate materialization of abstract human labour, and thus to labour which is of the same kind as that which is objectified within the linen itself. The object, coat, counts for it as a sensually palpable objectification of human labour of the same kind, and consequently as value in natural form. Since it is, as value, of the same essence as the coat, the natural form coat thereby becomes the form of appearance of its own value. But the labour represented in the use-value, coat, is not simply human labour, but is rather a particular useful labour: tailoring. Simple human labour (expenditure of human labour-power) is capable of receiving each and every determination, it is true, but is undetermined just in and for itself. It can only realize and objectify itself as soon as human labour-power is expended in a determined form, as determined and specified labour; because it is only determined and specified labour which can be confronted by some natural entity – an external material in which labour objectifies itself. It is only the ‘concept’ in Hegel’s sense that manages to objectify itself without external material.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

The aspect of the use value, coat, however, which is of interest to the linen is neither its woollen comfort, nor its buttoned-up essence nor any other useful quality which marks it out as a use-value. The coat is of service to the linen only in order to represent the linen’s value-objectivity as distinguished from its starchy use-objectivity. It could have attained the same purpose if it had expressed its value in assa foetida or cosmetics, or shoe polish. The tailoring labour, too, has value for the linen, consequently, not insofar as it is purposeful productive labour, but only insofar as it exists as determinate labour, form of realization, manner of objectification of human labour in general. If linen expressed its value in shoe polish rather than in the coat, then polish-making would count for it as the immediate form of realization of abstract human labour instead of tailoring. So a use-value or commodity-body only becomes a form of appearance of value or an Equivalent by another commodity’s relating itself to the concrete, useful species of labour contained in it, as the immediate form of realization of abstract human labour.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition
275,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"We stand here at the jumping-off point of all difficulties which hinder the understanding of value-form. It is relatively easy to distinguish the value of the commodity from its use-value, or the labour which forms the use-value from that same labour insofar as it is merely reckoned as the expenditure of human labour power in the commodity-value. If one considers commodity or labour in the one form, then one fails to consider it in the other, and vice versa. These abstract opposites fall apart on their own, and hence are easy to keep separate. It is different with the value-form which exists only in the relationship of commodity to commodity. The use-value or commodity-body is here playing a new role. It is turning into the form of appearance of the commodity-value, thus of its own opposite. Similarly, the concrete, useful labour contained in the use-value turns into its own opposite, to the mere form of realization of abstract human labour. Instead of falling apart, the opposing determinations of the commodity are reflected against one another. However incomprehensible this seems at first sight, it reveals itself upon further consideration to be necessary. The commodity is right from the start a dual thing, use-value and value, product of useful labour and abstract coagulate of labour. In order to manifest itself as what it is, it must therefore double its form. It possesses right from nature the form of a use-value. That is its natural form. It only earns a value form for itself for the first time in circulation with other commodities. But its value-form has then to be itself an objective form. The only objective forms of commodities are their use forms, their natural forms.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition
276,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"Now since the natural form of a commodity (e.g., linen) is the exact opposite of its value-form, it has to turn another natural form – the natural form of another commodity – into its commodity form. A thing that it cannot do immediately for itself it can do immediately for another commodity, and therefore by a detour for itself. It cannot express its value in its own body or in its own use-value, but it can relate itself to another use-value or commodity-body as an immediately existent value. It can relate itself not to the concrete labour contained in itself, but doubtless to that contained in another species of commodity as a mere form of realization of abstract human labour. For that, it only needs to equate the other commodity to itself as an Equivalent. The use-value of a commodity only exists at all for another commodity insofar as it serves in this fashion for the form of appearance of its value. If one considers only the quantitative relationship in the simple, relative value-expression: x commodity A = y commodity B, then one finds also only the laws developed above concerning the motion of relative value, which all rest upon the fact that the amount of value of commodities is determined by the labour-time required for their production.

The linen expresses its value and its determinate amount of value in the coat. It manifests its value in the value-relation to another commodity, and hence as exchange-value. On the other hand, the other commodity, the coat in which it expresses its value in a relative way, obtains precisely in that way the form of a use-value as an equivalent which is immediately exchangeable with it. Both forms, the relative value-form of the one commodity, equivalent form of the other, are forms of exchange-value. Both are actually only vectors – determinations conditioned reciprocally by each other – of the same relative value-expression, but divided like poles between the two commodity-extremes which have been set equal.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

The determinate relationship (e.g., in which coat is the equivalent of linen) does not flow from its equivalent-form, the form of its immediate exchangeability with linen, but from the determination of the amount of value by labour-time. The linen is only able to represent its own value in coats, by relating itself to a determinate coat-quantum as a given quantum of crystallized human labour. If the coat-value changes, then this relationship also changes. But in order that relative value of linen may change, it has to be present, and it can only be formed upon given coat-value. Now, whether the linen represents its own value in 1, 2 or x coats depends (under this presupposition) completely upon the amount of value of a yard of linen and the number of yards whose value is supposed to be manifested in the form of coats. The amount of value of a commodity can only express it in the use-value of another commodity as relative value. A commodity only obtains the form of an immediately exchangeable use-value (which is what is meant by ‘equivalent’) on the other hand, only as the material in which the value of another commodity is expressed.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

In the relative value of the linen (20 yards of linen = 1 coat), the exchange-value of linen is expressly manifested as its relationship to another commodity. As far as the coat is concerned, it is admittedly an Equivalent insofar as linen is related to the coat as form of appearance of its own value, and hence as something immediately exchangeable with itself (the linen). Only within this relationship is the coat an Equivalent. But it conducts itself passively. It seizes no kind of initiative. It finds itself in relationship because things relate themselves to it. The character which is constituted for it out of its relationship with the linen thus does not appear as the result of its own relating, but as present without any additional activity of its own. In addition, the specific mode and manner in which the linen relates to the coat is exactly appropriate to the end of doing it to the coat, however modest it be and however far from being the product of a ‘tailor run mad with pride’. The linen, after all, relates itself to the coat as the sensually existing materialization of human labour in abstracto and hence as present value-body.

Originally it only contained the fact that the value of the coat obtains through its expression in another commodity a form which is different from and independent of the exchange-value coat or even the body of the coat. Now the very same form manifests the coat with respect to all other commodities whatsoever as value. Not only the coat, but also coffee, iron, wheat, in a word, all other commodities express their value in the material, linen. In this way, all manifest themselves to one another as the same materialization of human labour. They are henceforward only quantitatively different, which is the reason why one coat, u coffee, x iron, etc. – i.e., different quanta of these different things – equal 20 yards of linen (equal to the same quantum of objectified human labour). It is through their common value-expression in the material, linen, therefore, that all commodities differ as exchange-values from their own use-values and relate at the same time to one another as amounts of value, equate themselves qualitatively to one another, and compare themselves quantitatively. Only in this unified relative value-expression do they all appear for the first time as values for one another, and their value consequently obtains for the first time its corresponding form of appearance as exchange-value.

No individual species of commodity counts any longer with respect to the linen as simple Equivalent, as in the particular Equivalent, but only as specific Equivalent whereby the one Equivalent excludes the other.

It is as if alongside and external to lions, tigers, rabbits, and all other actual animals, which form when grouped together the various kinds, species, subspecies, families etc. of the animal kingdom, there existed also in addition the animal, the individual incarnation of the entire animal kingdom. Such a particular which contains within itself all really present species of the same entity is a universal (like animal, god, etc.).

By the coat’s displaying its value in linen, it related itself to linen as the realized human labour, and precisely thereby related itself to linen-weaving as the realization-form of human labour, but the specific determinacy which distinguishes linen-weaving from other kinds of labour was completely indifferent. It only had to be of another kind than tailoring and in any case had to be a specific kind of labour. It is otherwise as soon as linen becomes a universal Equivalent. This use-value – in its special determinacy through which it is linen as opposed to all other kinds of commodities (coffee, iron, etc.) – now becomes the universal form of value of all other commodities and hence a universal Equivalent. The particular useful kind of labour manifested in it therefore now counts as universal form of realization of human labour, as universal labour precisely insofar as it is labour of particular determinacy: linen weaving as opposed, not only to tailoring, but to coffee growing, mining, and all other kinds of labour.

As a useful thing, a commodity possesses social determinacy insofar as it is use-value for people other than its possessor, and hence satisfies social needs. But it is indifferent just whose needs the commodity’s useful properties relate it to. The commodity nevertheless can only become through these properties in all cases only an object related to human needs, but not a commodity for other commodities. It is only the kind of thing that can turn mere objects of use into commodities and hence set into social rapport. But this is just what value is. The form in which the commodities count to one another as values – as coagulations of human labour – is consequently their social form.

295,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"In actuality, it differs thus only in the fact that the linen has continued its development from a singular to a universal Equivalent. Thus if in the simple relative expression of value it is not that commodity which expresses its amount of value, but rather that commodity in which the amount of value is expressed which is the one that obtains the form of immediate exchangeability (equivalent form: hence, immediately social form), the same thing holds true for the universal relative value expression. But in the simple relative form of value this distinction is merely formal and evanescent. If the coat expresses its value in a relative way (that is, in linen) in the equation ‘One coat = 20 yards of linen’, and the linen acquires thereby the form of Equivalent, then the very same equation includes immediately the reciprocity ‘20 yards of linen – one coat’, in which it is the coat that acquires the form of Equivalent and the value of the linen is expressed in a relative way. This constant and correlative development of the value-form of both commodities as relative value and as Equivalent no longer takes place. If the universal relative value-form, ‘One coat = 20 yards of linen’, (where the linen is universal Equivalent) is turned around into ‘20 yards of linen = one coat’, the coat does not thereby become universal Equivalent for all other commodities, but only a particular Equivalent of the linen. The relative value-form of the coat is only universal because it is the relative value-form of all other commodities at the same time. What holds true of the coat, holds true of coffee, etc. It follows, therefore, that the universal relative value-form of commodities excludes these very commodities from the universal form of Equivalent. On the other hand, a commodity like linen is excluded from the universal relative value-form as soon as it possesses the universal form of Equivalent. The universal relative value form of linen, unified with the other commodities, would be ‘20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen’. But this is a tautology which does not express the amount of value of this commodity, which is situated in a universal form of Equivalent – and thereby in perpetually exchangeable form. Rather, it is the developed relative value-form (20 yards of linen = one coat or u coffee or = v tea or = etc.) that now becomes the specific relative value-expression of the universal Equivalent.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

But the natural forms which they possess as objects of use count for them reciprocally as forms of appearance of value only over this detour, and consequently not in an immediate way. They are not for that reason immediately exchangeable just because of the way they immediately are. Thus they do not possess the form of immediate exchangeability for one another; i.e., their socially valid form is a mediated one. It is the other way around.

A single commodity, therefore, only finds itself in the form of immediate exchangeability with all other commodities, and therefore in immediately social form, because and insofar as all other commodities do not find themselves therein, or because the commodity by its very nature does not in general find itself in an immediately exchangeable or social form, by virtue of the fact that its immediate form is the form of its use-value, not of its value.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

On the other hand, this differing useful quality does not yet make products into commodities. If a peasant family produces coat, linen and wheat for its own consumption, then these things confront the family as differing products of their family labour, but do not confront one another reciprocally as commodities. If the commodity were immediately social (i.e., common) labour, then the products would acquire the immediately social character of a common product for its producers, but not the character of commodities for one another. Nevertheless, we do not have far to seek, in this case, for that in which the social form of the private labours consists, which are contained in the commodities and are independent of one another. It already yielded itself out of the analysis of the commodity. The commodities’ social form is their relationship to one another as equal labour; hence – since the equality of toto coelo  different labours can only consist in an abstraction from their inequality their relationship to one another as human labour in general: expenditures of human labour-power, which is what all human labours – whatever their content and their mode of operation – actually are. In each social form of labour, the labours of different individuals are related to one another as human labours too, but in this case this relating itself counts as the specifically social form of the labours. Now none of these private labours in its natural form possesses this specifically social form of abstract human labour, just as little as the commodity in its natural form possesses the social form of mere coagulation of labour, or value. However, through the fact that the natural form of a commodity (linen, in this case) becomes a universal Equivalent-form because all other commodities relate themselves to this natural form as the appearance-form of their own value, hence linen-weaving also turns into a universal form of realization of abstract human labour or into labour of immediately social form. The standard of ‘socialness’ must be borrowed from the nature of those relationships which are proper to each mode of production, and not from conceptions which are foreign to it. Just as we demonstrated earlier that the commodity naturally excludes the immediate form of universal exchange-ability and that the universal Equivalent-form consequently can only develop in a contradictory way, so the same thing holds for the private labours lurking in the commodities. Since they are not-immediately social labour, in the first place the social form is a form which differs from the natural forms of the real, useful labours and is foreign to them and abstract; and in the second place, all kinds of private labour obtain their social character only In a contradictory way, by all being equated to one exclusive kind of private labour (linen-weaving, in this case). This latter thereby becomes the immediate and universal form of appearance of abstract human labour and thereby labour in immediately social form.

The simple relative value-expression was the seed out of which the universal Equivalent-form of linen developed. It changes its role within this development. It begins by displaying its amount of value in one other commodity and ends by serving as material for the value-expression of all other commodities. What holds for linen holds for every commodity. In its developed relative value-expression (form II) – which only consists of its many, simple value-expressions – the linen does not yet figure as universal Equivalent.

There is absolutely nothing of a riddle in the fact that man changes by his activity the forms of natural matter in a way which is useful to him. The form of wood, for example, is changed if one makes a table out of it. Nevertheless, the table remains wood, an ordinary, sensual thing. But as soon as it steps out as commodity, it metamorphoses itself into a sensually supersensual thing.

Despite the variety of his productive functions, he knows that they are only various forms of activity of one and the same Robinson, and thus are only different modes of human labour. Necessity itself compels him to divide his time exactly between his various functions. Whether the one takes more space and the other takes less in the totality of his activity depends upon the greater or lesser difficulty which must be overcome for the attainment of the intended useful effect. Experience teaches him that much, and our Robinson who saved watch, diary, ink and pen from the shipwreck begins to keep a set of books about himself like a good Englishman. His inventory contains a list of the objects of use which he possesses, of the various operations which are required for their production, and finally of the labour-time which particular quanta of these various products cost him on the average.

The total product of the organization is a social product. One part of this product serves again as means of production. It remains social. But another part is used up by the members of the organization as necessities. This part must be divided up among them. The manner of this division will change with the particular manner of the social production-organism itself and the comparable historical level of development of the producers. Only for the sake of the parallel with commodity-production do we presuppose that each producer’s share of necessities of life is determined by his labour-time. In such a case, the labour-time would play a dual role. Its socially planned distribution controls the correct proportion of the various labour-functions to the various needs. On the other hand, the labour-time serves at the same time as the measure of the individual share of the producer in the common labour, and thereby also in the part of the common product which can be used up by individuals.

313,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"If men relate their products to one another as values insofar as these objects count as merely objectified husks of homogeneous human labour, there lies at the same time in that relationship the reverse, that their various labours only count as homogeneous human labour when under objectified husk. They relate their various labours to one another as human labour by relating their products to one another as values. The personal relationship is concealed by the objectified form. So just what a value is does not stand written on its forehead. In order to relate their products to one another as commodities, men are compelled to equate their various labours to abstract human labour. They do not know it, but they do it, by reducing the material thing to the abstraction, value. This is a primordial and hence unconsciously instinctive operation of their brain, which necessarily grows out of the particular manner of their material production and the relationships into which this production sets them. First their relationship exists in a practical mode. Second, however, their relationship exists as relationship for them. The way in which it exists for them or is reflected in their brain arises from the very nature of the relationship. Later, they attempt to get behind the mystery of their own social product by the aid of science, for the determination of a thing as value is their product, just as much as speech. Now as far as concerns the amount of value, we note that the private labours which are plied independently of one another (but because they are members of the primordial division of labour are dependent upon one another) on all sides are constantly reduced to their socially proportional measure by the fact that in the accidental and perpetually shifting exchange relationships of their products the labour-time which is socially necessary for their production forcibly obtrudes itself as a regulating natural-law, just as the law of gravity does, for example, when the house falls down on one’s head. The determination of the amount of value by the labour-time is consequently the mystery lurking under the apparent motions of the relative commodity-values. The producers’ own social movement possesses for them the form of a motion of objects under the control of which the producers lie instead of controlling the motion. As far as concerns the value-form finally, we note that it is just exactly this form which objectively veils the social relationships of private workers and consequently the social determinations of private labours, instead of laying them bare. If I say that coat, boots, etc. relate themselves to linen as universal materialization of abstract human labour, the insanity in such a way of putting things leaps into view.

315,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm,"The private producers only enter into social contact for the first time through their private products: objects. The social relationships of their labours are and appear consequently not as immediately social relationships of persons in their labours, but as objectified relationships of persons, or social relationships of objects. The first and most universal manifestation of the object as a social thing, however, is the metamorphosis of the product of labour into a commodity. The mysticism of the commodity arises, therefore, from the fact that the social determinations of the private labours of the private producers appear to them as social natural determinations of products of labour; from the fact, that is, that the social relationships of production of persons appear as social relationships of objects to one another and to the persons involved. The relationships of the private workers to the totality of social labour objectify themselves over against them and exist, consequently, for them in the forms of objects. To a society of commodity producers whose universally social relationship of production consists in their behaving toward their products as commodities (hence as values) and their relating their private labours to one another in this objective form as equal human labour, it is Christianity that is the most appropriate form of religion, with its cult of the abstract man – especially in its bourgeois development, Protestantism, Deism, etc. In the ancient Asian, antique, etc. modes of production, the metamorphosis of the product into a commodity and accordingly the existence of man as commodity-producer plays a subordinate role, which, however, becomes greater the more the communities enter upon the stage of their decline. Genuine commercial people only exist in the interstices of the ancient world, like the gods of Epicurus or like the Jews in the pores of Polish society. Those ancient social organisms of production are extraordinarily much more simple and transparent than the bourgeois organism, but they are based either on the immaturity of the individual man who has not yet torn himself free of the umbilicus of the natural species-connection with other men or are based upon immediate master and slave relationships. They are conditioned by a low level of development of the productive powers of labour by correspondingly restricted relationships of men within their material process of the constitution of life, and consequently to one another and to nature. This actual restrictedness reflects itself in an idealist mode in the ancient natural and popular religions. The religious reflection of the real world can only disappear as soon as the relationships of practical work-a-day life represent for men daily transparently reasonable relationships to one another and to nature. But relationships can only represent themselves as what they are. The form of the social process of life (i.e., of the material process of production) will only cast off its mystic veil of fog once it stands as a product of freely socialized men under their conscious, planned control. For that to happen, however, a material basis of society is demanded or a row of material conditions of existence which are themselves again the primordial product of a long and painful history of development.",Ch. 1 as per First German Edition

It has been observed that in the relationship of commodity to commodity (e.g., of shoe to shoe-shine boy) the use-value of the shoe-shine boy (i.e., the utility of his real, material properties) is completely irrelevant to the shoe. The shoeshine boy is of interest to the commodity, shoe, only as form of appearance of its own value. So if commodities could speak, they would say: ‘Our use-value may be of interest to a man. But it does not inhere in us insofar as we are things. It is our exchange-value that inheres in us as things. Our own circulation as commodity-things proves that. It is only as exchange-values that we relate ourselves to one another.’ Now just listen to how the economists speak forth from the very soul of the commodity: ‘Value (exchange-value) is a property of things, riches (use-value) of man. Value, in this sense, necessarily implies exchanges, riches do not.’ (Anonymous, 1821) ‘Riches (use-value) are the attribute of man; value is the attribute of commodities. A man or a community is rich; a pearl or a diamond is valuable . . . A pearl or a diamond is valuable as a pearl or diamond .’ (S. Bailey) Up to now, no chemist has discovered exchange-value in pearl or diamond. Our authors, who lay claim to special critical depth find, nevertheless, that use-value inheres in objects independently of their material properties, but their exchange-value on the other hand inheres in them as objects. The remarkable circumstance that the use-value of things realizes itself for men without exchange (thus, in the immediate relationship between thing and man), but their value on the other hand realizes itself only in exchange (that is, in a social process) is what strengthens them in their belief.

A born leveller and a cynic, it is always ready to exchange  not only soul, but body, with any and every other commodity, be the same  more repulsive than Maritornes herself. The owner makes up for this lack  in the commodity of a sense of the concrete, by his own five and more senses.  His commodity possesses for himself no immediate use-value. Otherwise,  he would not bring it to the market. It has use-value for others; but for  himself its only direct use-value is that of being a depository of exchange-value,  and, consequently, a means of exchange. Therefore,  he makes up his mind to part with it for commodities whose value in use  is of service to him. All commodities are non-use-values for their owners,  and use-values for their non-owners. Consequently, they must all change  hands. But this change of hands is what constitutes their exchange, and  the latter puts them in relation with each other as values, and realises  them as values. Hence commodities must be realised as values before they  can be realised as use-values.  ",Exchange

On the other hand, he desires to realise the value of his commodity, to  convert it into any other suitable commodity of equal value, irrespective  of whether his own commodity has or has not any use-value for the owner  of the other. From this point of view, exchange is for him a social transaction  of a general character.

To the owner of a commodity,  every other commodity is, in regard to his own, a particular equivalent,  and consequently his own commodity is the universal equivalent for all  the others. But since this applies to every owner, there is, in fact, no  commodity acting as universal equivalent, and the relative value of commodities  possesses no general form under which they can be equated as values and  have the magnitude of their values compared. So far, therefore, they do  not confront each other as commodities, but only as products or use-values.

The historical progress  and extension of exchanges develops the contrast, latent in commodities,  between use-value and value. The necessity for giving an external expression  to this contrast for the purposes of commercial intercourse, urges on the  establishment of an independent form of value, and finds no rest until  it is once for all satisfied by the differentiation of commodities into  commodities and money. At the same rate, then, as the conversion of products  into commodities is being accomplished, so also is the conversion of one  special commodity into money.  ",Exchange
338,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch02.htm,"The direct barter of products attains the elementary form of the  relative expression of value in one respect, but not in another. That form  is x Commodity A = y Commodity B. The form of direct barter is x use-value  A = y use-value B. The articles A and B in this case  are not as yet commodities, but become so only by the act of barter. The  first step made by an object of utility towards acquiring exchange-value  is when it forms a non-use-value for its owner, and that happens when it  forms a superfluous portion of some article required for his immediate  wants. Objects in themselves are external to man, and consequently alienable  by him. In order that this alienation may be reciprocal, it is only necessary  for men, by a tacit understanding, to treat each other as private owners  of those alienable objects, and by implication as independent individuals.  But such a state of reciprocal independence has no existence in a primitive  society based on property in common, whether such a society takes the form  of a patriarchal family, an ancient Indian community, or a Peruvian Inca  State. The exchange of commodities, therefore, first begins on the boundaries  of such communities, at their points of contact with other similar communities,  or with members of the latter. So soon, however, as products once become  commodities in the external relations of a community, they also, by reaction,  become so in its internal intercourse. The proportions in which they are  exchangeable are at first quite a matter of chance. What makes them exchangeable  is the mutual desire of their owners to alienate them. Meantime the need  for foreign objects of utility gradually establishes itself. The constant  repetition of exchange makes it a normal social act. In the course of time,  therefore, some portion at least of the products of labour must be produced  with a special view to exchange. From that moment the distinction becomes  firmly established between the utility of an object for the purposes of  consumption, and its utility for the purposes of exchange. Its use-value  becomes distinguished from its exchange-value. On the other hand, the quantitative  proportion in which the articles are exchangeable, becomes dependent on  their production itself. Custom stamps them as values with definite magnitudes.  ",Exchange
339,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch02.htm,"In the direct barter of products, each commodity is directly a  means of exchange to its owner, and to all other persons an equivalent,  but that only in so far as it has use-value for them. At this stage, therefore,  the articles exchanged do not acquire a value-form independent of their  own use-value, or of the individual needs of the exchangers. The necessity  for a value-form grows with the increasing number and variety of the commodities  exchanged. The problem and the means of solution arise simultaneously.  Commodity-owners never equate their own commodities to those of others,  and exchange them on a large scale, without different kinds of commodities  belonging to different owners being exchangeable for, and equated as values  to, one and the same special article. Such last-mentioned article, by becoming  the equivalent of various other commodities, acquires at once, though within  narrow limits, the character of a general social equivalent. This character  comes and goes with the momentary social acts that called it into life.  In turns and transiently it attaches itself first to this and then to that  commodity. But with the development of exchange it fixes itself firmly  and exclusively to particular sorts of commodities, and becomes crystallised  by assuming the money-form. The particular kind of commodity to which it  sticks is at first a matter of accident. Nevertheless there are two circumstances  whose influence is decisive. The money-form attaches itself either to the  most important articles of exchange from outside, and these in fact are  primitive and natural forms in which the exchange-value of home products  finds expression; or else it attaches itself to the object of utility that  forms, like cattle, the chief portion of indigenous alienable wealth. Nomad  races are the first to develop the money-form, because all their worldly  goods consist of moveable objects and are therefore directly alienable;  and because their mode of life, by continually bringing them into contact  with foreign communities, solicits the exchange of products. Man has often  made man himself, under the form of slaves, serve as the primitive material  of money, but has never used land for that purpose. Such an idea could  only spring up in a bourgeois society already well developed. It dates  from the last third of the 17th century, and the first attempt to put it  in practice on a national scale was made a century afterwards, during the  French bourgeois revolution.  ",Exchange

An adequate  form of manifestation of value, a fit embodiment of abstract, undifferentiated,  and therefore equal human labour, that material alone can be whose every  sample exhibits the same uniform qualities.

Money, like every  other commodity, cannot express the magnitude of its value except relatively  in other commodities.

What appears to happen is, not that gold becomes money,  in consequence of all other commodities expressing their values in it,  but, on the contrary, that all other commodities universally express their  values in gold, because it is money. The intermediate steps of the process  vanish in the result and leave no trace behind. Commodities find their  own value already completely represented, without any initiative on their  part, in another commodity existing in company with them. These objects,  gold and silver, just as they come out of the bowels of the earth, are  forthwith the direct incarnation of all human labour. Hence the magic of  money. In the form of society now under consideration, the behaviour of  men in the social process of production is purely atomic. Hence their relations  to each other in production assume a material character independent of  their control and conscious individual action. These facts manifest themselves  at first by products as a general rule taking the form of commodities.

The values of these commodities are,  therefore, changed in imagination into so many different quantities of  gold. Hence, in spite of the confusing variety of the commodities themselves,  their values become magnitudes of the same denomination, gold-magnitudes.  They are now capable of being compared with each other and measured, and  the want becomes technically felt of comparing them with some fixed quantity  of gold as a unit measure. This unit, by subsequent division into aliquot  parts, becomes itself the standard or scale. Before they become money,  gold, silver, and copper already possess such standard measures in their  standards of weight, so that, for example, a pound weight, while serving  as the unit, is, on the one hand, divisible into ounces, and, on the other,  may be combined to make up hundredweights.  It is  owing to this that, in all metallic currencies, the names given to the  standards of money or of price were originally taken from the pre-existing  names of the standards of weight.

It is the measure of value  inasmuch as it is the socially recognised incarnation of human labour;  it is the standard of price inasmuch as it is a fixed weight of metal.  As the measure of value it serves to convert the values of all the manifold  commodities into prices, into imaginary quantities of gold; as the standard  of price it measures those quantities of gold. The measure of values measures  commodities considered as values; the standard of price measures, on the  contrary, quantities of gold by a unit quantity of gold, not the value  of one quantity of gold by the weight of another. In order to make gold  a standard of price, a certain weight must be fixed upon as the unit. In  this case, as in all cases of measuring quantities of the same denomination,  the establishment of an unvarying unit of measure is all-important. Hence,  the less the unit is subject to variation, so much the better does the  standard of price fulfil its office. But only in so far as it is  itself a product of labour, and, therefore, potentially variable in value,  can gold serve as a measure of value.  ","Money,

No matter how this value varies, the proportions between the values of  different quantities of the metal remain constant. However great the fall  in its value, 12 ounces of gold still have 12 times the value of 1 ounce;  and in prices, the only thing considered is the relation between different  quantities of gold. Since, on the other hand, no rise or fall in the value  of an ounce of gold can alter its weight, no alteration can take place  in the weight of its aliquot parts.

On the other hand, a general fall in prices can result only,  either from a fall in the values of commodities — the value of money remaining  constant — or from a rise in the value of money, the values of commodities  remaining constant. It therefore by no means follows, that a rise in the  value of money necessarily implies a proportional fall in the prices of  commodities; or that a fall in the value of money implies a proportional  rise in prices. Such change of price holds good only in the case of commodities  whose value remains constant. With those, for example, whose value rises,  simultaneously with, and proportionally to, that of money, there is no  alteration in price.

This discrepancy  is the result of historical causes, among which the chief are: — (1) The  importation of foreign money into an imperfectly developed community. This  happened in Rome in its early days, where gold and silver coins circulated  at first as foreign commodities. The names of these foreign coins never  coincide with those of the indigenous weights. (2) As wealth increases,  the less precious metal is thrust out by the more precious from its place  as a measure of value, copper by silver, silver by gold, however much this  order of sequence may be in contradiction with poetical chronology.

Since  the standard of money is on the one hand purely conventional, and must  on the other hand find general acceptance, it is in the end regulated by  law. A given weight of one of the precious metals, an ounce of gold, for  instance, becomes officially divided into aliquot parts, with legally bestowed  names, such as pound, dollar, &c. These aliquot parts, which thenceforth  serve as units of money, are then subdivided into other aliquot parts with  legal names, such as shilling, penny, &c.  But, both  before and after these divisions are made, a definite weight of metal is  the standard of metallic money. The sole alteration consists in the subdivision  and denomination.    ","Money,

Hence, instead of saying: A quarter of wheat is worth an ounce of gold;  we say, it is worth £3 17s. 10 1/2d. In this way commodities express  by their prices how much they are worth, and money serves as money of  account whenever it is a question of fixing the value of an article  in its money-form.

I know nothing of a man, by knowing that his name is Jacob.  In the same way with regard to money, every trace of a value-relation disappears  in the names pound, dollar, franc, ducat, &c. The confusion caused  by attributing a hidden meaning to these cabalistic signs is all the greater,  because these money-names express both the values of commodities, and,  at the same time, aliquot parts of the weight of the metal that is the  standard of money.

Hence the expression of the equivalence of a commodity with the sum of  money constituting its price, is a tautology,   just as in general the expression of the relative value of a commodity  is a statement of the equivalence of two commodities. But although price,  being the exponent of the magnitude of a commodity’s value, is the exponent  of its exchange-ratio with money, it does not follow that the exponent  of this exchange-ratio is necessarily the exponent of the magnitude of  the commodity’s value. Suppose two equal quantities of socially necessary  labour to be respectively represented by 1 quarter of wheat and £2  (nearly 1/2 oz. of gold), £2 is the expression in money of the magnitude  of the value of the quarter of wheat, or is its price. If now circumstances  allow of this price being raised to £3, or compel it to be reduced  to £1, then although £1 and £3 may be too small or too  great properly to express the magnitude of the wheat’s value; nevertheless  they are its prices, for they are, in the first place, the form under which  its value appears, i.e., money; and in the second place, the exponents  of its exchange-ratio with money. If the conditions of production, in other  words, if the productive power of labour remain constant, the same amount  of social labour-time must, both before and after the change in price,  be expended in the reproduction of a quarter of wheat. This circumstance  depends, neither on the will of the wheat producer, nor on that of the  owners of other commodities.  ","Money,

As soon as magnitude of value is converted into price, the above necessary  relation takes the shape of a more or less accidental exchange-ratio between  a single commodity and another, the money-commodity. But this exchange-ratio  may express either the real magnitude of that commodity’s value, or the  quantity of gold deviating from that value, for which, according to circumstances,  it may be parted with. The possibility, therefore, of quantitative incongruity  between price and magnitude of value, or the deviation of the former from  the latter, is inherent in the price-form itself. This is no defect, but,  on the contrary, admirably adapts the price-form to a mode of production  whose inherent laws impose themselves only as the mean of apparently lawless  irregularities that compensate one another.

Objects that in themselves are no commodities, such as conscience, honour,  &c., are capable of being offered for sale by their holders, and of  thus acquiring, through their price, the form of commodities. Hence an  object may have a price without having value. The price in that case is  imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics. On the other hand, the  imaginary price-form may sometimes conceal either a direct or indirect  real value-relation; for instance, the price of uncultivated land, which  is without value, because no human labour has been incorporated in it.

Commodities as use-values now stand opposed to money as exchange-value.  On the other hand, both opposing sides are commodi ties, unities of  use-value and value. But this unity of differences manifests itself at  two opposite poles, and at each pole in an opposite way. Being poles they  are as necessarily opposite as they are connected. On the one side of the  equation we have an ordinary commodity, which is in reality a use-value.  Its value is expressed only ideally in its price, by which it is equated  to its opponent, the gold, as to the real embodiment of its value. On the  other hand, the gold, in its metallic reality, ranks as the embodiment  of value, as money. Gold, as gold, is exchange-value itself. As to its  use-value, that has only an ideal existence, represented by the series  of expressions of relative value in which it stands face to face with all  other commodities, the sum of whose uses makes up the sum of the various  uses of gold.

The linen, which  in his eyes is a mere commodity, a depository of value, he alienates in  exchange for gold, which is the linen’s value-form, and this form he again  parts with for another commodity, the Bible, which is destined to enter  his house as an object of utility and of edification to its inmates. The  exchange becomes an accomplished fact by two metamorphoses of opposite  yet supplementary character — the conversion of the commodity into money,  and the re-conversion of the money into a commodity.

404,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"The leap taken by value from the body of the commodity, into the body  of the gold, is, as I have elsewhere called it, the salto mortale of the  commodity. If it falls short, then, although the commodity itself is not  harmed, its owner decidedly is. The social division of labour causes his  labour to be as one-sided as his wants are many-sided. This is precisely  the reason why the product of his labour serves him solely as exchange-value.  But it cannot acquire the properties of a socially recognised universal  equivalent, except by being converted into money. That money, however,  is in some one else’s pocket. In order to entice the money out of that  pocket, our friend’s commodity must, above all things, be a use-value to  the owner of the money. For this, it is necessary that the labour expended  upon it, be of a kind that is socially useful, of a kind that constitutes  a branch of the social division of labour. But division of labour is a  system of production which has grown up spontaneously and continues to  grow behind the backs of the producers. The commodity to be exchanged may  possibly be the product of some new kind of labour, that pretends to satisfy  newly arisen requirements, or even to give rise itself to new requirements.  A particular operation, though yesterday, perhaps, forming one out of the  many operations conducted by one producer in creating a given commodity,  may to-day separate itself from this connexion, may establish itself as  an independent branch of labour and send its incomplete product to market  as an independent commodity. The circumstances may or may not be ripe for  such a separation. To-day the product satisfies a social want. Tomorrow  the article may, either altogether or partially, be superseded by some  other appropriate product. Moreover, although our weaver’s labour may be  a recognised branch of the social division of labour, yet that fact is  by no means sufficient to guarantee the utility of his 20 yards of linen.  If the community’s want of linen, and such a want has a limit like every  other want, should already be saturated by the products of rival weavers,  our friend’s product is superfluous, redundant, and consequently  useless. Although people do not look a gift-horse in the mouth, our friend  does not frequent the market for the purpose of making presents. But suppose  his product turn out a real use-value, and thereby attracts money? The  question arises, how much will it attract? No doubt the answer is already  anticipated in the price of the article, in the exponent of the magnitude  of its value. We leave out of consideration here any accidental miscalculation  of value by our friend, a mistake that is soon rectified in the market.  We suppose him to have spent on his product only that amount of labour-time  that is on an average socially necessary. The price then, is merely the  money-name of the quantity of social labour realised in his commodity. But  without the leave, and behind the back, of our weaver, the old-fashioned  mode of weaving undergoes a change. The labour-time that yesterday was  without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen,  ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too  eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors. Unluckily  for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every  piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially  necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have  had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach  the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves  that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been  expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual  weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is  socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together,  hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of  commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter  of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form  of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour.   ","Money,

405,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"We see then, commodities are in love with money, but “the course  of true love never did run smooth.” The quantitative division of labour  is brought about in exactly the same spontaneous and accidental manner  as its qualitative division. The owners of commodities therefore find out,  that the same division of labour that turns them into independent private  producers, also frees the social process of production and the relations  of the individual producers to each other within that process, from all  dependence on the will of those producers, and that the seeming mutual  independence of the individuals is supplemented by a system of general  and mutual dependence through or by means of the products.

Here, however, we are only concerned with the phenomenon in  its integrity, and we therefore assume its progress to be normal.

But for  what is the commodity exchanged? For the shape assumed by its own value,  for the universal equivalent. And for what is the gold exchanged? For a  particular form of its own use-value. Why does gold take the form of money  face to face with the linen? Because the linen’s price of £2, its  denomination in money, has already equated the linen to gold in its character  of money. A commodity strips off its original commodity-form on being alienated,  i.e., on the instant its use-value actually attracts the gold, that  before existed only ideally in its price. The realisation of a commodity’s  price, or of its ideal value-form, is therefore at the same time the realisation  of the ideal use-value of money; the conversion of a commodity into money,  is the simultaneous conversion of money into a commodity. The apparently  single process is in reality a double one. From the pole of the commodity-owner  it is a sale, from the opposite pole of the money-owner, it is a purchase.

At the  same time the prices, wooing glances cast at money by commodities, define  the limits of its convertibility, by pointing to its quantity. Since every  commodity, on becoming money, disappears as a commodity, it is impossible  to tell from the money itself, how it got into the hands of its possessor,  or what article has been changed into it.

But suppose the seller of the Bible  turns the £2 set free by the weaver into brandy M—C, the concluding  phase of C—M—C (linen—money—Bible), is also C—M, the first phase  of C—M—C (Bible—money—brandy). The producer of a particular commodity  has that one article alone to offer; this he sells very often in large  quantities, but his many and various wants compel him to split up the price  realised, the sum of money set free, into numerous purchases.

But just as,  upon every such transmutation of a commodity, its two forms, commodity-form  and money-form, exist simultaneously but at opposite poles, so every seller  has a buyer opposed to him, and every buyer a seller. While one particular  commodity is going through its two transmutations in succession, from a  commodity into money and from money into another commodity,  the owner of the commodity changes in succession his part from that of  seller to that of buyer.

But this  is true only so far as he himself is concerned. The seller of the Bible,  who prefers something to warm his inside, no more thought of exchanging  his Bible for linen than our weaver knew that wheat had been exchanged  for his linen. B’s commodity replaces that of A, but A and B do not mutually  exchange those commodities. It may, of course, happen that A and B make  simultaneous purchases, the one from the other; but such exceptional transactions  are by no means the necessary result of the general conditions of the circulation  of commodities. We see here, on the one hand, how the exchange of commodities  breaks through all local and personal bounds inseparable from direct barter,  and develops the circulation of the products of social labour; and on the  other hand, how it develops a whole network of social relations spontaneous  in their growth and entirely beyond the control of the actors. It is only  because the farmer has sold his wheat that the weaver is enabled to sell  his linen, only because the weaver has sold his linen that our Hotspur  is enabled to sell his Bible, and only because the latter has sold the  water of everlasting life that the distiller is enabled to sell his eau-de-vie,  and so on.

418,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"Nothing can be more childish than the dogma, that because every  sale is a purchase, and every purchase a sale, therefore the circulation  of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium of sales and purchases.  If this means that the number of actual sales is equal to the number of  purchases, it is mere tautology. But its real purport is to prove that  every seller brings his buyer to market with him. Nothing of the kind.  The sale and the purchase constitute one identical act, an exchange between  a commodity-owner and an owner of money, between two persons as opposed  to each other as the two poles of a magnet. They form two distinct acts,  of polar and opposite characters, when performed by one single  person. Hence the identity of sale and purchase implies that the commodity  is useless, if, on being thrown into the alchemistical retort of circulation,  it does not come out again in the shape of money; if, in other words, it  cannot be sold by its owner, and therefore be bought by the owner of the  money. That identity further implies that the exchange, if it does take place,  constitutes a period of rest, an interval, long or short, in the life of  the commodity. Since the first metamorphosis of a commodity is at once  a sale and a purchase, it is also an independent process in itself. The  purchaser has the commodity, the seller has the money, i.e., a commodity  ready to go into circulation at any time. No one can sell unless some one  else purchases. But no one is forthwith bound to purchase, because he has  just sold. Circulation bursts through all restrictions as to time, place,  and individuals, imposed by direct barter, and this it effects by splitting  up, into the antithesis of a sale and a purchase, the direct identity that  in barter does exist between the alienation of one’s own and the acquisition  of some other man’s product. To say that these two independent and antithetical  acts have an intrinsic unity, are essentially one, is the same as to say  that this intrinsic oneness expresses itself in an external antithesis.  If the interval in time between the two complementary phases of the complete  metamorphosis of a commodity become too great, if the split between the  sale and the purchase become too pronounced, the intimate connexion between  them, their oneness, asserts itself by producing — a crisis. The antithesis,  use-value and value; the contradictions that private labour is bound to  manifest itself as direct social labour, that a particularised concrete  kind of labour has to pass for abstract human labour; the contradiction  between the personification of objects and the representation of persons  by things; all these antitheses and contradictions, which are immanent  in commodities, assert themselves, and develop their modes of motion, in  the antithetical phases of the metamorphosis of a commodity. These modes  therefore imply the possibility, and no more than the possibility, of crises.  The conversion of this mere possibility into a reality is the result of  a long series of relations, that, from our present standpoint of simple  circulation, have as yet no existence.  ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
419,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"The change of form, C—M—C, by which the circulation of the material  products of labour is brought about, requires that a given value in the  shape of a commodity shall begin the process, and shall, also in the shape  of a commodity, end it. The movement of the commodity is therefore a circuit.  On the other hand, the form of this movement precludes a circuit from being  made by the money. The result is not the return of the money, but its continued  removal further and further away from its starting-point. So long as the  seller sticks fast to his money, which is the transformed shape of his  commodity, that commodity is still in the first phase of its metamorphosis,  and has completed only half its course. But so soon as he completes the  process, so soon as he supplements his sale by a purchase, the money again  leaves the hands of its possessor. It is true that if the weaver, after  buying the Bible, sell more linen, money comes back into his hands. But  this return is not owing to the circulation of the first 20 yards of linen;  that circulation resulted in the money getting into the hands of the seller  of the Bible. The return of money into the hands of the weaver is brought  about only by the renewal or repetition of the process of circulation with  a fresh commodity, which renewed process ends with the same result as its  predecessor did. Hence the movement directly imparted to money by the circulation  of commodities takes the form of a constant motion away from its starting-point,  of a course from the hands of one commodity-owner into those of another.  This course constitutes its currency (cours de la monnaie).    ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
420,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"The currency of money is the constant and monotonous repetition  of the same process. The commodity is always in the hands of the seller;  the money, as a means of purchase, always in the hands of the buyer. And  money serves as a means of purchase by realising the price of the commodity.  This realisation transfers the commodity from the seller to the buyer and  removes the money from the hands of the buyer into those of the seller,  where it again goes through the same process with another commodity. That  this one-sided character of the money’s motion arises out of the two-sided  character of the commodity’s motion, is a circumstance that is veiled over.  The very nature of the circulation of commodities begets the  opposite appearance. The first metamorphosis of a commodity is visibly,  not only the money’s movement, but also that of the commodity itself; in  the second metamorphosis, on the contrary, the movement appears to us as  the movement of the money alone. In the first phase of its circulation  the commodity changes place with the money. Thereupon the commodity, under  its aspect of a useful object, falls out of circulation into consumption.   ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
421,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"Again, money functions as a means of circulation only because  in it the values of commodities have independent reality. Hence its movement,  as the medium of circulation, is, in fact, merely the movement of commodities  while changing their forms. This fact must therefore make itself plainly  visible in the currency of money. Thus the linen for instance, first of  all changes its commodity-form into its money-form. The second term of its  first metamorphosis, C—M, the money form, then becomes the  first term of its final metamorphosis, M—C, its re-conversion into the  Bible. But each of these two changes of form is accomplished by an exchange  between commodity and money, by their reciprocal displacement. The  same pieces of coin come into the seller’s hand as the alienated  form of the commodity and leave it as the absolutely alienable form  of the commodity. They are displaced twice. The first metamorphosis  of the linen puts these coins into the weaver’s pocket, the second draws  them out of it. The two inverse changes undergone by the same commodity  are reflected in the displacement, twice repeated, but in opposite directions,  of the same pieces of coin.  ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
422,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"If, on the contrary, only one phase of the metamorphosis is gone  through, if there are only sales or only purchases, then a given piece  of money changes its place only once. Its second change of place always  expresses the second metamorphosis of the commodity, its re-conversion  from money. The frequent repetition of the displacement of the same coins  reflects not only the series of metamorphoses that a single commodity has  gone through, but also the intertwining of the innumerable metamorphoses  in the world of commodities in general. It is a matter of course, that  all this is applicable to the simple circulation of commodities alone,  the only form that we are now considering.  ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
423,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"Every commodity, when it first steps into circulation, and undergoes  its first change of form, does so only to fall out of circulation again  and to be replaced by other commodities. Money, on the contrary, as the  medium of circulation, keeps continually within the sphere of circulation,  and moves about in it. The question therefore arises, how much money this  sphere constantly absorbs?  ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
424,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"In a given country there take place every day at the same time,  but in different localities, numerous one-sided metamorphoses of commodities,  or, in other words, numerous sales and numerous purchases. The commodities  are equated beforehand in imagination, by their prices, to definite quantities  of money. And since, in the form of circulation now under consideration,  money and commodities always come bodily face to face, one at the positive  pole of purchase, the other at the negative pole of sale, it is clear that  the amount of the means of circulation required, is determined beforehand  by the sum of the prices of all these commodities. As a matter of fact,  the money in reality represents the quantity or sum of gold ideally expressed  beforehand by the sum of the prices of the commodities. The equality of  these two sums is therefore self-evident. We know, however, that, the values  of commodities remaining constant, their prices vary with the value of  gold (the material of money), rising in proportion as it falls, and falling  in proportion as it rises. Now if, in consequence of such a rise or fall  in the value of gold, the sum of the prices of commodities fall or rise,  the quantity of money in currency must fall or rise to the same  extent. The change in the quantity of the circulating medium is, in this  case, it is true, caused by the money itself, yet not in virtue of its  function as a medium of circulation, but of its function as a measure of  value. First, the price of the commodities varies inversely as the value  of the money, and then the quantity of the medium of circulation varies  directly as the price of the commodities. Exactly the same thing would  happen if, for instance, instead of the value of gold falling, gold were  replaced by silver as the measure of value, or if, instead of the value  of silver rising, gold were to thrust silver out from being the measure  of value. In the one case, more silver would be current than gold was before;  in the other case, less gold would be current than silver was before. In  each case the value of the material of money, i.e., the value of  the commodity that serves as the measure of value, would have undergone  a change, and therefore so, too, would the prices of commodities which  express their values in money, and so, too, would the quantity of money  current whose function it is to realise those prices. We have already seen,  that the sphere of circulation has an opening through which gold (or the  material of money generally) enters into it as a commodity with a given  value. Hence, when money enters on its functions as a measure of value,  when it expresses prices, its value is already determined. If now its value  fall, this fact is first evidenced by a change in the prices of those commodities  that are directly bartered for the precious metals at the sources of their  production. The greater part of all other commodities, especially in the  imperfectly developed stages of civil society, will continue for a long  time to be estimated by the former antiquated and illusory value of the  measure of value. Nevertheless, one commodity infects another through their  common value-relation, so that their prices, expressed in gold or in silver,  gradually settle down into the proportions determined by their comparative  values, until finally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms  of the new value of the metal that constitutes money. This process is accompanied  by the continued increase in the quantity of the precious metals, an increase  caused by their streaming in to replace the articles directly bartered  for them at their sources of production. In proportion therefore as commodities  in general acquire their true prices, in proportion as their values become  estimated according to the fallen value of the precious metal, in the same  proportion the quantity of that metal necessary for realising those new  prices is provided beforehand. A one-sided observation of the results that  followed upon the discovery of fresh supplies of gold and silver, led some  economists in the 17th, and particularly in the 18th century, to the false  conclusion, that the prices of commodities had gone up in consequence of  the increased quantity of gold and silver serving as means of circulation.  Henceforth we shall consider the value of gold to be given, as, in fact,   it is momentarily, whenever we estimate the price of a commodity.","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
425,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"  On this supposition then, the quantity of the medium of circulation is  determined by the sum of the prices that have to be realised. If now we  further suppose the price of each commodity to be given, the sum of the  prices clearly depends on the mass of commodities in circulation. It requires  but little racking of brains to comprehend that if one quarter of wheat  costs £2,100 quarters will cost £200, 200 quarters £400,  and so on, that consequently the quantity of money that changes place with  the wheat, when sold, must increase with the quantity of that wheat.  ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
426,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"If the mass of commodities remain constant, the quantity of circulating  money varies with the fluctuations in the prices of those commodities.  It increases and diminishes because the sum of the prices increases or  diminishes in consequence of the change of price. To produce this effect,  it is by no means requisite that the prices of all commodities should rise  or fall simultaneously. A rise or a fall in the prices of a number of leading  articles, is sufficient in the one case to increase, in the other to diminish,  the sum of the prices of all commodities, and, therefore, to put more or  less money in circulation. Whether the change in the price correspond to  an actual change of value in the commodities, or whether it be the result  of mere fluctuations in market-prices, the effect on the quantity of the  medium of circulation remains the same. Suppose the following articles  to be sold or partially metamorphosed simultaneously in different localities:  say, one quarter of wheat, 20 yards of linen, one Bible, and 4 gallons  of brandy. If the price of each article be £2, and the sum of the  prices to be realised be consequently £8, it follows that £8  in money must go into circulation. If, on the other hand, these same articles  are links in the following chain of  metamorphoses: 1 quarter of wheat — £2 — 20 yards of linen — £2  — 1 Bible — £2 — 4 gallons of brandy — £2, a chain that  is already well known to us, in that case the £2 cause the different  commodities to circulate one after the other, and after realising their  prices successively, and therefore the sum of those prices, £8, they  come to rest at last in the pocket of the distiller. The £2 thus  make four moves. This repeated change of place of the same pieces of money  corresponds to the double change in form of the commodities, to their motion  in opposite directions through two stages of circulation. and to the interlacing  of the metamorphoses of different commodities.   These antithetic and complementary phases, of which the process  of metamorphosis consists, are gone through, not simultaneously, but successively.  Time is therefore required for the completion of the series. Hence the  velocity of the currency of money is measured by the number of moves made  by a given piece of money in a given time. Suppose the circulation of the  4 articles takes a day. The sum of the prices to be realised in the day  is £8, the number of moves of the two pieces of money is four, and  the quantity of money circulating is £2. Hence, for a given interval  of time during the process of circulation, we have the following relation:  the quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium is equal to  the sum of the prices of the commodities divided by the number of moves  made by coins of the same denomination. This law holds generally.  ","Money,
or the Circulation of Commodities"
427,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"The total circulation of commodities in a given country during  a given period is made up on the one hand of numerous isolated and simultaneous  partial metamorphoses, sales which are at the same time purchases, in which  each coin changes its place only once, or makes only one move; on the other  hand, of numerous distinct series of metamorphoses partly running side  by side, and partly coalescing with each other, in each of which series  each coin makes a number of moves, the number being greater or less according  to circumstances. The total number of moves made by all the circulating  coins of one denomination being given, we can arrive at the average number  of moves made by a single coin of that denomination, or at the average  velocity of the currency of money. The quantity of money thrown into the  circulation at the beginning of each day is of course determined by the  sum of the prices of all the commodities circulating simultaneously side  by side. But once in circulation, coins are, so to say, made responsible  for one another. If the one increase its velocity, the other either retards  its own, or altogether falls out of circulation; for the circulation can  absorb only such a quantity of gold as when multiplied by the mean number  of moves made by one single coin or element, is equal to the sum of the  prices to be realised. Hence if the number of moves made by the separate  pieces increase, the total number of those pieces in circulation diminishes.  If the number of the moves diminish, the total number of pieces increases.  Since the quantity of money capable of being absorbed by the circulation  is given for a given mean velocity of currency, all that is necessary in  order to abstract a given number of sovereigns from the circulation is  to throw the same number of one-pound notes into it, a trick well known  to all bankers.

428,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"Just as the currency of money, generally considered, is but a  reflex of the circulation of commodities, or of the antithetical metamorphoses  they undergo, so, too, the velocity of that currency reflects the rapidity  with which commodities change their forms, the continued interlacing of  one series of metamorphoses with another, the hurried social interchange  of matter, the rapid disappearance of commodities from the sphere of circulation,  and the equally rapid substitution of fresh ones in their places. Hence,  in the velocity of the currency we have the fluent unity of the antithetical  and complementary phases, the unity of the conversion of the useful aspect  of commodities into their value-aspect, and their re-conversion from the  latter aspect to the former, or the unity of the two processes of sale  and purchase. On the other hand, the retardation of the currency reflects  the separation of these two processes into isolated antithetical phases,  reflects the stagnation in the change of form, and therefore, in the social  interchange of matter. The circulation itself, of course, gives no clue  to the origin of this stagnation; it merely puts in evidence the phenomenon  itself. The general public, who, simultaneously with the retardation of  the currency, see money appear and disappear less frequently at the periphery  of circulation, naturally attribute this retardation to a quantitative  deficiency in the circulating medium.

On this rapidity depends what proportion of the sum  of the prices can, on the average, be realised by each single coin. But  the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities depends on the quantity,  as well as on the prices, of the commodities. These three factors, however,  state of prices, quantity of circulating commodities, and velocity of money-currency,  are all variable.

Name and substance,  nominal weight and real weight, begin their process of separation. Coins  of the same denomination become different in value, because they are different  in weight. The weight of gold fixed upon as the standard of prices, deviates  from the weight that serves as the circulating medium, and the latter thereby  ceases any longer to be a real equivalent of the commodities whose prices  it realises. The history of coinage during the middle ages and down into  the 18th century, records the ever renewed confusion arising from this  cause. The natural tendency of circulation to convert coins into a mere  semblance of what they profess to be, into a symbol of the weight of metal  they are officially supposed to contain, is recognised by modern legislation,  which fixes the loss of weight sufficient to demonetise a gold coin, or  to make it no longer legal tender.

The practical difficulties in the way of coining  extremely minute quantities of gold or silver, and the circumstance that  at first the less precious metal is used as a measure of value instead  of the-more precious, copper instead of silver, silver instead of gold,  and that the less precious circulates as money until dethroned by the more  precious — all these facts explain the parts historically played by silver  and copper tokens as substitutes for gold coins. Silver and copper tokens  take the place of gold in those regions of the circulation where  coins pass from hand to hand most rapidly, and are subject to the maximum  amount of wear and tear. This occurs where sales and purchases on a very  small scale are continually happening. In order to prevent these satellites  from establishing themselves permanently in the place of gold, positive  enactments determine the extent to which they must be compulsorily received  as payment instead of gold. The particular tracks pursued by the different  species of coin in currency, run naturally into each other. The tokens  keep company with gold, to pay fractional parts of the smallest gold coin;  gold is, on the one hand, constantly pouring into retail circulation, and  on the other hand is as constantly being thrown out again by being changed  into tokens.

Therefore things that are  relatively without value, such as paper notes, can serve as coins in its  place. This purely symbolic character is to a certain extent masked in  metal tokens.

In  so far as they actually take the place of gold to the same amount, their  movement is subject to the laws that regulate the currency of money itself.  A law peculiar to the circulation of paper money can spring up only from  the proportion in which that paper money represents gold. Such a law exists;  stated simply, it is as follows: the issue of paper money must not exceed  in amount the gold (or silver as the case may be) which would actually  circulate if not replaced by symbols. Now the quantity of gold which the  circulation can absorb, constantly fluctuates about a given level. Still,  the mass of the circulating medium in a given country never sinks below  a certain minimum easily ascertained by actual experience. The fact that  this minimum mass continually undergoes changes in its constituent parts,  or that the pieces of gold of which it consists are being constantly replaced  by fresh ones, causes of course no change either in its amount or in the  continuity of its circulation. It can therefore be replaced by paper symbols.  If, on the other hand, all the conduits of circulation were to-day filled  with paper money to the full extent of their capacity for absorbing money,  they might to-morrow be overflowing in consequence of a fluctuation in  the circulation of commodities. There would no longer be any standard.  If the paper money exceed its proper limit, which is the amount in gold  coins of the like denomination that can actually be current, it would,  apart from the danger of falling into general disrepute, represent only  that quantity of gold, which, in accordance with the laws of the circulation  of commodities, is required, and is alone capable of being represented  by paper. If the quantity of paper money issued be double what it ought  to be, then, as a matter of fact, £1 would be the money-name not  of 1/4 of an ounce, but of 1/8 of an ounce of gold. The effect would be  the same as if an alteration had taken place in the function of gold as  a standard of prices.

442,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm,"Finally, some one may ask why gold is capable of being replaced  by tokens that have no value? But, as we have already seen, it is capable  of being so replaced only in so far as it functions exclusively as coin,  or as the circulating medium, and as nothing else. Now, money has other  functions besides this one, and the isolated function of serving as the  mere circulating medium is not necessarily the only one attached to gold  coin, although this is the case with those abraded coins that continue  to circulate. Each piece of money is a mere coin, or means of circulation,  only so long as it actually circulates. But this is just the case with  that minimum mass of gold, which is capable of being replaced by paper  money. That mass remains constantly within the sphere of circulation, continually  functions as a circulating medium, and exists exclusively for that purpose.  Its movement therefore represents nothing but the continued alternation  of the inverse phases of the metamorphosis C—M—C, phases in which commodities  confront their value-forms, only to disappear again immediately. The independent  existence of the exchange-value of a commodity is here a transient apparition,  by means of which the commodity is immediately replaced by another commodity.  Hence, in this process which continually makes money pass from hand to  hand, the mere symbolical existence of money suffices. Its functional existence  absorbs, so to say, its material existence. Being a transient and objective  reflex of the prices of commodities, it serves only as a symbol of itself,  and is therefore capable of being replaced by a token.   One thing is, however, requisite; this token must have an objective  social validity of its own, and this the paper symbol acquires by its forced  currency. This compulsory action of the State can take effect only within  that inner sphere of circulation which is coterminous with the territories  of the community, but it is also only within that sphere that money completely  responds to its function of being the circulating medium, or becomes coin.","Money,

It is then the money-commodity, neither merely ideal, as in its  function of a measure of value, nor capable of being represented, as in  its function of circulating medium. On the other hand, it also functions  as money, when by virtue of its function, whether that function be performed  in person or by representative, it congeals into the sole form of value,  the only adequate form of existence of exchange-value, in opposition to  use-value, represented by all other commodities.

This naive form of hoarding becomes perpetuated in those communities in  which the traditional mode of production is carried on for the supply of  a fixed and limited circle of home wants. It is thus with the people of  Asia, and particularly of the East Indies. Vanderlint, who fancies that  the prices of commodities in a country are determined by the quantity of  gold and silver to be found in it, asks himself why Indian commodities  are so cheap. Answer: Because the Hindus bury their money. From 1602 to  1734, he remarks, they buried 150 millions of pounds sterling of silver,  which originally came from America to Europe.  In  the 10 years from 1856 to 1866, England exported to India and China £120,000,000  in silver, which had been received in exchange for Australian gold.

But the value of  a commodity measures the degree of its attraction for all other elements  of material wealth, and therefore measures the social wealth of its owner.  To a barbarian owner of commodities, and even to a West-European peasant,  value is the same as value-form, and therefore to him the increase in  his hoard of gold and silver is an increase in value. It is true that the  value of money varies, at one time in consequence of a variation in its  own value, at another, in consequence of a change in the values of commodities.  But this, on the one hand, does not prevent 200 ounces of gold from still  containing more value than 100 ounces, nor, on the other hand, does it  hinder the actual metallic form of this article from continuing to be the  universal equivalent form of all other commodities, and the immediate social  incarnation of all human labour. The desire after hoarding is in its very  nature unsatiable. In its qualitative aspect, or formally considered, money  has no bounds to its efficacy, i.e., it is the universal representative  of material wealth, because it is directly convertible into any other commodity.  But, at the same time, every actual sum of money is limited in amount,  and, therefore, as a means of purchasing, has only a limited efficacy.  This antagonism between the quantitative limits of money and its qualitative  boundlessness, continually acts as a spur to the hoarder in his Sisyphus-like  labour of accumulating.

We have seen how, along with  the continual fluctuations in the extent and rapidity of the circulation  of commodities and in their prices, the quantity of money current unceasingly  ebbs and flows. This mass must, therefore, be capable of expansion and  contraction. At one time money must be attracted in order to act as circulating  coin, at another, circulating coin must be repelled in order to act again  as more or less stagnant money. In order that the mass of money, actually  current, may constantly saturate the absorbing power of the circulation,  it is necessary that the quantity of gold and silver in a country be greater  than the quantity required to function as coin. This condition is fulfilled  by money taking the form of hoards. These reserves serve as conduits for  the supply or withdrawal of money to or from the circulation, which in  this way never overflows its banks.  ","Money,

The owners of commodities came  therefore into contact as the respective representatives of what were already  equivalents. But with the development of circulation, conditions arise  under which the alienation of commodities becomes separated, by an interval  of time, from the realisation of their prices. It will be sufficient  to indicate the most simple of these conditions. One sort of article requires  a longer, another a shorter time for its production. Again, the production  of different commodities depends on different seasons of the year. One  sort of commodity may be born on its own market place, another has to make  a long journey to market. Commodity-owner No. 1, may therefore be ready  to sell, before No. 2 is ready to buy. When the same transactions are continually  repeated between the same persons, the conditions of sale are regulated  in accordance with the conditions of production. On the other hand, the  use of a given commodity, of a house, for instance, is sold (in common  parlance, let) for a definite period. Here, it is only at the end of the  term that the buyer has actually received the use-value of the commodity.  He therefore buys it before he pays for it. The vendor sells an existing  commodity, the purchaser buys as the mere representative of money, or rather  of future money. The vendor becomes a creditor, the purchaser becomes a  debtor. Since the metamorphosis of commodities, or the development of their  value-form, appears here under a new aspect, money also acquires a fresh  function; it becomes the means of payment.    ","Money,

At first, therefore, these new parts are  just as transient and alternating as those of seller and buyer, and are  in turns played by the same actors. But the opposition is not nearly so  pleasant, and is far more capable of crystallisation.   The same characters can, however, be assumed independently of the circulation  of commodities. The class-struggles of the ancient world took the form  chiefly of a contest between debtors and creditors, which in Rome ended  in the ruin of the plebeian debtors. They were displaced by slaves. In  the middle ages the contest ended with the ruin of the feudal debtors,  who lost their political power together with the economic basis on which  it was established. Nevertheless, the money relation of debtor and creditor  that existed at these two periods reflected only the deeper-lying antagonism  between the general economic conditions of existence of the classes in  question.

The appearance  of the two equivalents, commodities and money, at the two poles of the  process of sale, has ceased to be simultaneous. The money functions now,  first as a measure of value in the determination of the price of the commodity  sold; the price fixed by the contract measures the obligation of the debtor,  or the sum of money that he has to pay at a fixed date. Secondly, it serves  as an ideal means of purchase. Although existing only in the promise of  the buyer to pay, it causes the commodity to change hands. It is not before  the day fixed for payment that the means of payment actually steps into  circulation, leaves the hand of the buyer for that of the seller. The circulating  medium was transformed into a hoard, because the process stopped short  after the first phase, because the converted shape of the commodity, viz.,  the money, was withdrawn from circulation. The means of payment enters  the circulation, but only after the commodity has left it. The money is  no longer the means that brings about the process. It only brings it to  a close, by stepping in as the absolute form of existence of exchange-value,  or as the universal commodity. The seller turned his commodity into money,  in order thereby to satisfy some want, the hoarder did the same in order  to keep his commodity in its money-shape, and the debtor in order to be  able to pay; if he do not pay, his goods will be sold by the sheriff.

That quantity is conditioned by two circumstances: first the relations  between debtors and creditors form a sort of chain, in such a way that  A, when he receives money from his debtor B, straightway hands it over to  C his creditor, and so on; the second circumstance is the length of the  intervals between the different due-days of the obligations. The continuous  chain of payments, or retarded first metamorphoses, is essentially different  from that interlacing of the series of metamorphoses which we considered  on a former page. By the currency of the circulating medium, the connexion  between buyers and sellers, is not merely expressed. This connexion is  originated by, and exists in, the circulation alone.

The debts due  to A from B, to B from C, to C from A, and so on, have only to be confronted  with each other, in order to annul each other to a certain extent like  positive and negative quantities.

Hence, even when prices, rapidity of currency, and the  extent of the economy in payments, are given, the quantity of money current  and the mass of commodities circulating during a given period, such as  a day, no longer correspond. Money that represents commodities long withdrawn  from circulation, continues to be current. Commodities circulate, whose  equivalent in money will not appear on the scene till some future day.

This is evident,  since their taking the form of commodities implies their differentiation  into commodities and money. Or, why cannot private labour — labour for  the account of private individuals — be treated as its opposite, immediate  social labour? I have elsewhere examined thoroughly the Utopian idea of   “labour-money” in a society founded on the production of commodities (l.  c., p. 61, seq.).

Owen pre-supposes  directly associated labour, a form of production that is entirely inconsistent  with the production of commodities. The certificate of labour is merely  evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labour, and  of his right to a certain portion of the common produce destined for consumption.

To assume that there is an invariable ratio between  the quantities of gold and silver in which a given quantity of labour-time  is incorporated, is to assume in fact, that gold and silver are of one  and the same material, and that a given mass of the less valuable metal,  silver, is a constant fraction of a given mass of gold. From the reign  of Edward III. to the time of George II., the history of money in England  consists of one long series of perturbations caused by the clashing of  the legally fixed ratio between the values of gold and silver, with the  fluctuations in their real values. At one time gold was too high, at another,  silver. The metal that for the time being was estimated below its value,  was withdrawn from circulation, mated and exported. The ratio between the  two metals was then again altered by law, but the new nominal ratio soon  came into conflict again with the real one. In our own times, the slight  and transient fall in the value of gold compared with silver, which was  a consequence of the Indo-Chinese demand for silver, produced on a far  more extended scale in France the same phenomena, export of silver, and  its expulsion from circulation by gold. During the years 1855, 1856 and  1857, the excess in France of gold-imports over gold-exports amounted to  £41,580,000, while the excess of silver-exports over silver-imports  was £14,704,000. In fact, in those countries in which both metals  are legally measures of value, and therefore both legal tender, so that  everyone has the option of paying in either metal, the metal that rises  in value is at a premium, and, like every other commodity, measures its  price in the over-estimated metal which alone serves in reality as the standard  of value. The result of all experience and history with regard to this  equation is simply that, where two commodities perform by law the functions  of a measure of value, in practice one alone maintains that position.”  ( l.c., pp. 52, 53.)","Money,

With regard to this subject, we may  notice two methods characteristic of apologetic economy. The first is the  identification of the circulation of commodities with the direct barter  of products, by simple abstraction from their points of difference; the  second is, the attempt to explain away the contradictions of capitalist  production, by reducing the relations between the persons engaged in that  mode of production, to the simple relations arising out of the circulation  of commodities. The production and circulation of commodities are however,  phenomena that occur to a greater or less extent in modes of production  the most diverse. If we are acquainted with nothing but the abstract categories  of circulation, which are common to all these modes of production, we cannot  possibly know anything of the specific points of difference of those modes,  nor pronounce any judgment upon them. In no science is such a big fuss  made with commonplace truisms as in Political Economy. For instance, J.  B.

(1) Either there is too much corn and cattel in the country, so that  most who come to market have need of selling, as he hath, and few of buying;  or (2) There wants the usual vent abroad by transportation..., or (3) The  consumption fails, as when men, by reason of poverty, do not spend so much  in their houses as formerly they did; wherefore it is not the increase  of specific money, which would at all advance the farmer’s goods, but the  removal of any of these three causes, which do truly keep down the market...

But if, on the one hand, it is a popular delusion to ascribe stagnation  in production and circulation to insufficiency of the circulating medium,  it by no means follows, on the other hand, that an actual paucity of the  medium in consequence, e.g., of bungling legislative interference  with the regulation of currency, may not give rise to such stagnation.","Money,

Just as there is a certain proportion  of farthings necessary in a small retail trade, to change silver money,  and to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest silver  pieces.... Now, as the proportion of the number of farthings requisite  in commerce is to be taken from the number of people, the frequency of  their exchanges: as also, and principally, from the value of the smallest  silver pieces of money; so in like manner, the proportion of money  requisite in our trade, is to be likewise taken from  the frequency of commutations, and from the bigness of the payments.” (William  Petty, “A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions.” Lond. 1667, p. 17.) The  Theory of Hume was defended against the attacks of J. Steuart and others,  by A. Young, in his “Political Arithmetic,” Lond. 1774, in which work there  is a special chapter entitled “Prices depend on quantity of money, at p.  112, sqq. I have stated in “Zur Kritik, &c.,” p. 149: “He (Adam Smith)  passes over without remark the question as to the quantity of coin in circulation,  and treats money quite wrongly as a mere commodity.” This statement applies  only in so far as Adam Smith, ex officio, treats of money. Now and then,  however, as in his criticism of the earlier systems of Political Economy,  he takes the right view. “The quantity of coin in every country is regulated  by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by It.... The  value of the goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain  quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper consumers,  and can give employment to no more. The channel of circulation necessarily  draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never admits any more.”  (“Wealth of Nations.” Bk. IV., ch. 1.) In like manner, ex officio, he opens  his work with an apotheosis on the division of labour. Afterwards, in the  last book which treats of the sources of public revenue, he occasionally  repeats the denunciations of the division of labour made by his teacher,  A. Ferguson.","Money,

A careful  comparison of this book with Hume’s “Essays,” proves to my mind without  doubt that Hume was acquainted with and made use of Vanderlint’s work,  which is certainly an important one. The opinion that prices are determined  by the quantity of the circulating medium, was also held by Barbon and  other much earlier writers. “No inconvenience,” says Vanderlint, “can arise  by an unrestrained trade, but very great advantage; since, if the cash  of the nation be decreased by it, which prohibitions are designed to prevent,  those nations that get the cash will certainly find everything advance  in price, as the cash increases amongst them. And ... our manufactures,  and everything else, will soon become so moderate as to turn the balance  of trade in our favour, and thereby fetch the money back again.” (l.c..  pp. 43, 44.)","Money,

That the price of each single kind  of commodity forms a part of the sum of the prices of all the commodities  in circulation, is a self-evident proposition. But how use-values which  are incommensurable with regard to each other, are to be exchanged, en  masse for the total sum of gold and silver in a country, is quite incomprehensible.  If we start from the notion that all commodities together form one single  commodity, of which each is but an aliquot part, we get the following beautiful  result: The total commodity = x cwt. of gold; commodity A = an aliquot  part of the total commodity = the same aliquot part of x cwt. of gold. This  is stated in all seriousness by Montesquieu: “Si l’on compare la masse  de l’or et de l’argent qui est dans le monde avec la somme des marchandises  qui s’y vend il est certain que chaque denrée ou marchandise, en particulier,  pourra être comparée à une certaine portion de la masse  entière. Supposons qu’il n’y ait qu’une seule denrée ou marchandise  dans le monde, ou qu’il n’y ait qu’une seule qui s’achète, et qu’elle se divise comme l’argent: Cette partie de cette marchandise répondra  à une partie de la masse de l’argent; la moitié du total  de l’une à la moitié du total de l’autre, &c.... L’établissement  du prix des choses dépend toujours fondamentalement de la raison  du total des choses au total des signes.”  (Montesquieu, l.c. t. III, pp.  12, 13.)

John Stuart Mill, with his usual eclectic  logic, understands how to hold at the same time the view of his father,  James Mill, and the opposite view. On a comparison of the text of his compendium,  “Principles of Pol.

The original researches of  Mr. J. S. Mill which are neither extensive nor profound, in the domain  of Political Economy, will be found mustered in rank and file in his little  work, “Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy,” which appeared in  1844. Locke asserts point blank the connexion between the absence of value  in gold and silver, and the determination of their values by quantity alone.  “Mankind having consented to put an imaginary value upon gold and silver  ... the intrinsic value, regarded in these metals, is nothing but the quantity.""

I will, however, cite for the benefit of the romantic sycophant,  Adam Muller, who admires the “generous liberality” with which the English  Government coins gratuitously, the following opinion of Sir Dudley North:  “Silver and gold, like other commodities, have their ebbings and flowings.  Upon the arrival of quantities from Spain ... it is carried into the Tower,  and coined. Not long after there will come a demand for bullion to be exported  again. If there is none, but all happens to be in coin, what then? Melt  it down again; there’s no loss in it, for the coining costs the owner nothing.  Thus the nation has been abused, and made to pay for the twisting of straw  for asses to eat. If the merchant were made to pay the price of the coinage,  he would not have sent his silver to the Tower without consideration, and  coined money would always keep a value above uncoined silver.” (North,  l.c., p. 18.)

But if there is as much silver as will transact  the small payments independent of gold, the retail trader must then receive  silver for small purchases, and it must of necessity accumulate in his  hands.” (David Buchanan; “Inquiry into the Taxation and Commercial Policy  of Great Britain.” Edinburgh, 1844, pp. 248, 249.)","Money,

Value of this description may be made to answer all the purposes  of intrinsic value, and supersede even the necessity for a standard, provided  only the quantity of the issues be kept under due limitation.” (Fullarton:  “Regulation of Currencies,” London, 1845, p. 21.)

This occurs constantly  under the every-day form of prepayments. And it is under this form, that  the English government purchases opium from the ryots of India.... In these  cases, however, the money always acts as a means of purchase.... Of course  capital also is advanced in the shape of money.... This point of view,  however, does not fall within the horizon of simple circulation.” (“Zur  Kritik, &c.,” pp. 119, 120.)","Money,

The monetary crisis referred to  in the text, being a phase of every crisis, must be clearly distinguished  from that particular form of crisis, which also is called a monetary crisis,  but which may be produced by itself as an independent phenomenon in such  a way as to react only indirectly on industry and commerce. The pivot of  these crises is to be found in moneyed capital, and their sphere of direct  action is therefore the sphere of that capital, viz., banking, the stock  exchange, and finance.","Money,

To the question, “If there were  occasion to raise 40 millions p. a., whether the same 6 millions (gold)  ... would suffice for such revolutions and circulations thereof, as trade  requires,” Petty replies in his usual masterly manner, “I answer yes: for  the expense being 40 millions, if the revolutions were in such short circles,  viz., weekly, as happens among poor artisans and labourers, who receive  and pay every Saturday, then 40/52 parts of 1 million of money would answer  these ends, but if the circles be quarterly, according to our custom of  paying rent, and gathering taxes, then 10 millions were requisite. Wherefore,  supposing payments in general to be of a mixed circle between one week  and 13, then add 10 millions to 40/52, the half of which will be 5 1/2,  so as if we have 5 1/2 millions we have enough.” (William Petty: “Political  Anatomy of Ireland.” 1672, Edit.: Lond. 1691, pp. 13, 14.)","Money,

The opponents, themselves, of the  mercantile system, a system which considered the settlement of surplus  trade balances in gold and silver as the aim of international trade, entirely  misconceived the functions of money of the world. I have shown by the example  of Ricardo in what way their false conception of the laws that regulate  the quantity of the circulating medium, is reflected in their equally false  conception of the international movement of the precious metals (l.c.,  pp. 150 sq.). His erroneous dogma: “An unfavourable balance of trade never  arises but from a redundant currency.... The exportation of the coin is  caused by its cheapness, and is not the effect, but the cause of an unfavourable  balance,” already occurs in Barbon: “The Balance of Trade, if there be  one, is not the cause of sending away the money out of a nation; but that  proceeds from the difference of the value of bullion in every country.”  (N. Barbon; l.c., pp. 59, 60.) MacCulloch in “The Literature of Political  Economy, a classified catalogue, Lond. 1845,” praises Barbon for this anticipation,  but prudently passes over the naive forms, in which Barbon clothes the  absurd supposition on which the “currency principle” is based. The absence  of real criticism and even of honesty, in that catalogue culminates in  the sections devoted to the history of the theory of money; the reason  is that MacCulloch in this part of the work is flattering Lord Overstone  whom he calls “facile princeps argentanorum.”","Money,

The production of commodities, their circulation, and that  more developed form of their circulation called commerce, these form the  historical ground-work from which it rises. The modern history of capital  dates from the creation in the 16th century of a world-embracing commerce  and a world-embracing market.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"

","The
General Formula for Capital"
552,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"As a matter of history, capital, as opposed to landed property,  invariably takes the form at first of money; it appears as moneyed wealth,  as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer.   But we have no need to refer to the origin of capital in order to discover  that the first form of appearance of capital is money. We can see it daily  under our very eyes. All new capital, to commence with, comes on the stage,  that is, on the market, whether of commodities, labour, or money, even  in our days, in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be  transformed into capital.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
553,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"The first distinction we notice between money that is money only,  and money that is capital, is nothing more than a difference in their form  of circulation.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
554,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"The simplest form of the circulation of commodities is C-M-C,  the transformation of commodities into money, and the change of the money  back again into commodities; or selling in order to buy. But alongside  of this form we find another specifically different form: M-C-M, the transformation  of money into commodities, and the change of commodities back again into  money; or buying in order to sell. Money that circulates in the latter  manner is thereby transformed into, becomes capital, and is already potentially  capital.     ","The
General Formula for Capital"
555,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"Now let us examine the circuit M-C-M a little closer. It consists,  like the other, of two antithetical phases. In the first phase, M-C, or  the purchase, the money is changed into a commodity. In the second phase,  C-M, or the sale, the commodity is changed back again into money. The combination  of these two phases constitutes the single movement whereby money is exchanged  for a commodity, and the same commodity is again exchanged for money; whereby  a commodity is bought in order to be sold, or, neglecting the distinction  in form between buying and selling, whereby a commodity is bought with  money, and then money is bought with a commodity.   The result, in which the phases of the process vanish, is the exchange  of money for money, M-M. If I purchase 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £100,  and resell the 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £110, I have, in fact, exchanged  £100 for £110, money for money.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
556,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"Now it is evident that the circuit M-C-M would be absurd and without  meaning if the intention were to exchange by this means two equal sums  of money, £100 for £100. The miser’s plan would be far simpler  and surer; he sticks to his £100 instead of exposing it to the dangers  of circulation. And yet, whether the merchant who has paid £100 for  his cotton sells it for £110, or lets it go for £100, or even  £50, his money has, at all events, gone through a characteristic  and original movement, quite different in kind from that which it goes  through in the hands of the peasant who sells corn, and with the money  thus set free buys clothes. We have therefore to examine first the distinguishing  characteristics of the forms of the circuits M-C-M and C-M-C, and in doing  this the real difference that underlies the mere difference of form will  reveal itself.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
557,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"Let us see, in the first place, what the two forms have in common.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
558,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"Both circuits are resolvable into the same two antithetical phases,  C-M, a sale, and M-C, a purchase. In each of these phases the same material  elements - a commodity, and money, and the same economic dramatis  personae, a buyer and a seller - confront one another. Each circuit is  the unity of the same two antithetical phases, and in each case this unity  is brought about by the intervention of three contracting parties, of whom  one only sells, another only buys, while the third both buys and sells.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
559,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"What, however, first and foremost distinguishes the circuit C-M-C  from the circuit M-C-M, is the inverted order of succession of the two  phases. The simple circulation of commodities begins with a sale and ends  with a purchase, while the circulation of money as capital begins with  a purchase and ends with a sale. In the one case both the starting-point  and the goal are commodities, in the other they are money. In the first  form the movement is brought about by the intervention of money, in the  second by that of a commodity.     ","The
General Formula for Capital"
560,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"In the circulation C-M-C, the money is in the end converted into  a commodity, that serves as a use-value; it is spent once for all. In the  inverted form, M-C-M, on the contrary, the buyer lays out money in order  that, as a seller, he may recover money. By the purchase of his commodity  he throws money into circulation, in order to withdraw it again by the  sale of the same commodity. He lets the money go, but only with the sly  intention of getting it back again. The money, therefore, is not spent,  it is merely advanced.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
561,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"In the circuit C-M-C, the same piece of money changes its place  twice. The seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller.  The complete circulation, which begins with the receipt, concludes with  the payment, of money for commodities. It is the very contrary in the circuit  M-C-M. Here it is not the piece of money that changes its place twice,  but the commodity. The buyer takes it from the hands of the seller and  passes it into the hands of another buyer. Just as in the simple circulation  of commodities the double change of place of the same piece of money effects  its passage from one hand into another, so here the double change of place  of the same commodity brings about the reflux of the money to its point  of departure.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
562,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"Such reflux is not dependent on the commodity being sold for more  than was paid for it. This circumstance influences only the amount of the  money that comes back. The reflux itself takes place, so soon as the purchased  commodity is resold, in other words, so soon as the circuit M-C-M is completed.  We have here, therefore, a palpable difference between the circulation  of money as capital, and its circulation as mere money.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
563,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"The circuit C-M-C comes completely to an end, so soon as  the money brought in by the sale of one commodity is abstracted again by  the purchase of another.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
564,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"If, nevertheless, there follows a reflux of money to its starting-point,  this can only happen through a renewal or repetition of the operation.  If I sell a quarter of corn for £3, and with this £3 buy clothes,  the money, so far as I am concerned, is spent and done with. It belongs  to the clothes merchant. If I now sell a second quarter of corn, money  indeed flows back to me, not however as a sequel to the first transaction,  but in consequence of its repetition. The money again leaves me, so soon  as I complete this second transaction by a fresh purchase. Therefore, in  the circuit C-M-C, the expenditure of money has nothing to do with its  reflux. On the other hand, in M-C-M, the reflux of the money is conditioned  by the very mode of its expenditure. Without this reflux, the operation  fails, or the process is interrupted and incomplete, owing to the absence  of its complementary and final phase, the sale.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
565,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"The circuit C-M-C starts with one commodity, and finishes with  another, which falls out of circulation and into consumption. Consumption,  the satisfaction of wants, in one word, use-value, is its end and aim.  The circuit M-C-M, on the contrary, commences with money and ends with  money. Its leading motive, and the goal that attracts it, is therefore  mere exchange-value.     ","The
General Formula for Capital"
566,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"In the simple circulation of commodities, the two extremes of  the circuit have the same economic form. They are both commodities, and  commodities of equal value. But they are also use-values differing in their  qualities, as, for example, corn and clothes. The exchange of products,  of the different materials in which the labour of society is embodied,  forms here the basis of the movement. It is otherwise in the circulation  M-C-M, which at first sight appears purposeless, because tautological.  Both extremes have the same economic form. They are both money, and therefore  are not qualitatively different use-values; for money is but the converted  form of commodities, in which their particular use-values vanish. To exchange  £100 for cotton, and then this same cotton again for £100,  is merely a roundabout way of exchanging money for money, the same for  the same, and appears to be an operation just as purposeless as it is absurd.   One sum of money is distinguishable from  another only by its amount. The character and tendency of the process M-C-M,  is therefore not due to any qualitative difference between its extremes,  both being money, but solely to their quantitative difference. More money  is withdrawn from circulation at the finish than was thrown into it at  the start. The cotton that was bought for £100 is perhaps resold  for £100 + £10 or £110. The exact form of this process  is therefore M-C-M', where M' = M + D M = the original sum advanced,  plus an increment. This increment or excess over the original value I call   “surplus-value.” The value originally advanced, therefore, not only remains  intact while in circulation, but adds to itself a surplus-value or expands  itself. It is this movement that converts it into capital.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
567,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"Of course, it is also possible, that in C-M-C, the two extremes  C-C, say corn and clothes, may represent different quantities of value.  The farmer may sell his corn above its value, or may buy the clothes at  less than their value. He may, on the other hand, “be done” by the clothes  merchant. Yet, in the form of circulation now under consideration, such  differences in value are purely accidental. The fact that the corn and  the clothes are equivalents, does not deprive the process of all meaning,  as it does in M-C-M. The equivalence of their values is rather a necessary  condition to its normal course.  ","The
General Formula for Capital"
568,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm,"The repetition or renewal of the act of selling in order to buy,  is kept within bounds by the very object it aims at, namely, consumption  or the satisfaction of definite wants, an aim that lies altogether outside  the sphere of circulation. But when we buy in order to sell, we, on the  contrary, begin and end with the same thing, money, exchange-value; and  thereby the movement becomes interminable. No doubt, M becomes M + D  M, £100 become £110. But when viewed in their qualitative aspect  alone, £110 are the same as £100, namely money; and considered  quantitatively, £110 is, like £100, a sum of definite and limited  value. If now, the £110 be spent as money, they cease to play their  part. They are no longer capital. Withdrawn from circulation,  they become petrified into a hoard, and though they remained in that state  till doomsday, not a single farthing would accrue to them. If, then, the  expansion of value is once aimed at, there is just the same inducement  to augment the value of the £110  as that of the £100; for both  are but limited expressions for exchange-value, and therefore both have  the same vocation to approach, by quantitative increase, as near as possible  to absolute wealth.  Momentarily, indeed, the value originally advanced,  the £100 is distinguishable from the surplus-value of £10 that  is annexed to it during circulation; but the distinction vanishes immediately.  At the end of the process, we do not receive with one hand the original  £100, and with the other, the surplus-value of £10. We simply  get a value of £110, which is in exactly the same condition and fitness  for commencing the expanding process, as the original £100 was. Money  ends the movement only to begin it again.           ","The

In truth, however,  value is here the active factor in a process, in which, while constantly  assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it at the same time  changes in magnitude, differentiates itself by throwing off surplus-value  from itself; the original value, in other words, expands spontaneously.  For the movement, in the course of which it adds surplus-value, is its  own movement, its expansion, therefore, is automatic expansion.

There is here no antagonism, as in the case of hoarding,  between the money and commodities.

So far as it is the art of gaining a livelihood,  it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence,  and useful either to a household or the state. “True wealth (o  aleqinos ploutos) consists of such values in use; for the quantity of  possessions of this kind, capable of making life pleasant, is not unlimited.  There is, however, a second mode of acquiring things, to which we may by  preference and with correctness give the name of Chrematistic, and in this  case there appear to be no limits to riches and possessions. Trade (e kapelike is literally retail trade, and Aristotle takes this kind because  in it values in use predominate) does not in its nature belong to Chrematistic,  for here the exchange has reference only to what is necessary to themselves  (the buyer or seller).” Therefore, as he goes on to show, the original  form of trade was barter, but with the extension of the latter, there arose  the necessity for money. On the discovery of money, barter of necessity  developed into kapelike, into trading in commodities, and this  again, in opposition to its original tendency, grew into Chrematistic,  into the art of making money. Now Chrematistic is distinguishable from  Oeconomic in this way, that “in the case of Chrematistic circulation is  the source of riches poietike crematon ... dia chrematon diaboles.  And it appears to revolve about money, for money is the beginning and end  of this kind of exchange (to nomisma stoiceion tes allages estin).  Therefore also riches, such as Chrematistic strives for, are unlimited.  Just as every art that is not a means to an end, but an end in itself,  has no limit to its aims, because it seeks constantly to approach nearer  and nearer to that end, while those arts that pursue means to an end, are  not boundless, since the goal itself imposes a limit upon them, so with  Chrematistic, there are no bounds to its aims, these aims being absolute  wealth. Oeconomic not Chrematistic has a limit ... the object of the former  is something different from money, of the latter the augmentation of money....  By confounding these two forms, which overlap each other, some people have  been led to look upon the preservation and increase of money ad infinitum  as the end and aim of Oeconomic.” (Aristoteles, De Rep. edit.

What distinguishes this form from that of the simple circulation  of commodities, is the inverted order of succession of the two antithetical  processes, sale and purchase. How can this purely formal distinction between  these processes change their character as it were by magic?  ","Contradictions
in the General Formula of Capital"
596,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch05.htm,"But that is not all. This inversion has no existence for two out  of the three persons who transact business together. As capitalist, I buy  commodities from A and sell them again to B, but as a simple owner of commodities,  I sell them to B and then purchase fresh ones from A. A and B see no difference  between the two sets of transactions. They are merely buyers or sellers.  And I on each occasion meet them as a mere owner of either money or commodities,  as a buyer or a seller, and, what is more, in both sets of transactions,  I am opposed to A only as a buyer and to B only as a seller, to the one  only as money, to the other only as commodities, and to neither of them  as capital or a capitalist, or as representative of anything that is more  than money or commodities, or that can produce any effect beyond what money  and commodities can. For me the purchase from A and the sale to B are part  of a series. But the connexion between the two acts exists for me alone.  A does not trouble himself about my transaction with B, nor does B about  my business with A. And if I offered to explain to them the meritorious  nature of my action in inverting the order of succession, they would probably  point out to me that I was mistaken as to that order of succession, and  that the whole transaction, instead of beginning with a purchase and ending  with a sale, began, on the contrary, with a sale and was concluded  with a purchase. In truth, my first act, the purchase, was from the standpoint  of A, a sale, and my second act, the sale, was from the standpoint of B,  a purchase. Not content with that, A and B would declare that the whole  series was superfluous and nothing but Hokus Pokus; that for the future  A would buy direct from B, and B sell direct to A. Thus the whole transaction  would be reduced to a single act forming an isolated, non-complemented  phase in the ordinary circulation of commodities, a mere sale from A’s  point of view, and from B’s, a mere purchase. The inversion, therefore,  of the order of succession, does not take us outside the sphere of the  simple circulation of commodities, and we must rather look, whether there  is in this simple circulation anything permitting an expansion of the value  that enters into circulation, and, consequently, a creation of surplus-value.     ","Contradictions

597,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch05.htm,"Let us take the process of circulation in a form under which it  presents itself as a simple and direct exchange of commodities. This is  always the case when two owners of commodities buy from each other, and  on the settling day the amounts mutually owing are equal and cancel each  other. The money in this case is money of account and serves to express  the value of the commodities by their prices, but is not, itself, in the  shape of hard cash, confronted with them. So far as regards use-values,  it is clear that both parties may gain some advantage. Both part with goods  that, as use-values, are of no service to them, and receive others that  they can make use of. And there may also be a further gain. A, who sells  wine and buys corn, possibly produces more wine, with given labour-time,  than farmer B could, and B on the other hand, more corn than wine-grower  A could. A, therefore, may get, for the same exchange-value, more corn,  and B more wine, than each would respectively get without any exchange  by producing his own corn and wine. With reference, therefore, to use-value,  there is good ground for saying that “exchange is a transaction by which  both sides gain.”  ","Contradictions

598,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch05.htm,"Abstractedly considered, that is, apart from circumstances not  immediately flowing from the laws of the simple circulation of commodities,  there is in an exchange nothing (if we except the replacing of one use-value  by another) but a metamorphosis, a mere change in the form of the commodity.  The same exchange-value, i.e., the same quantity of incorporated social  labour, remains throughout in the hands of the owner of the commodity,  first in the shape of his own commodity, then in the form of the money  for which he exchanged it, and lastly, in the shape of the commodity he  buys with that money. This change of form does not imply a change in the  magnitude of the value. But the change, which the value of the commodity  undergoes in this process, is limited to a change in its money-form. This  form exists first as the price of the commodity offered for sale, then  as an actual sum of money, which, however,   was already expressed in the  price, and lastly, as the price of an equivalent commodity. This change  of form no more implies, taken alone, a change in the quantity of value,  than does the change of a £5 note into sovereigns, half sovereigns  and shillings. So far therefore as the circulation of commodities effects  a change in the form alone of their values, and is free from disturbing  influences, it must be the exchange of equivalents. Little as Vulgar-Economy  knows about the nature of value, yet whenever it wishes to consider the  phenomena of circulation in their purity, it assumes that supply and demand  are equal, which amounts to this, that their effect is nil. If therefore,  as regards the use-values exchanged, both buyer and seller may possibly  gain something, this is not the case as regards the exchange-values. Here  we must rather say, “Where equality exists there can be no gain.”   ","Contradictions

599,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch05.htm,"Hence, we see that behind all attempts to represent the  circulation of commodities as a source of surplus-value, there lurks a  quid pro quo, a mixing up of use-value and exchange-value. For instance,  Condillac says: “It is not true that on an exchange of commodities we give  value for value. On the contrary, each of the two contracting parties in  every case, gives a less for a greater value. ... If we really exchanged  equal values, neither party could make a profit. And yet, they both gain,  or ought to gain. Why? The value of a thing consists solely in its relation  to our wants. What is more to the one is less to the other, and vice  versâ. ... It is not to be assumed that we offer for sale articles  required for our own consumption. ... We wish to part with a useless thing,  in order to get one that we need; we want to give less for more. ... It  was natural to think that, in an exchange, value was given for value, whenever  each of the articles exchanged was of equal value with the same quantity  of gold. ... But there is another point to be considered in our calculation.  The question is, whether we both exchange something superfluous for something  necessary.”   But commodities are not paid for twice over, once on account of their use-value,  and again on account of their value. And though the use-value of a commodity  is more serviceable to the buyer than to the seller, its money-form is  more serviceable to the seller. Would he otherwise sell it? We might therefore  just as well say that the buyer performs ""strictly an act of  production,” by converting stockings, for example, into money.  ","Contradictions

There is no creation  of surplus-value. And, in its normal form, the circulation of commodities  demands the exchange of equivalents. But in actual practice, the process  does not retain its normal form. Let us, therefore, assume an exchange  of non-equivalents.  ","Contradictions

The material variety of  these commodities is the material incentive to the act of exchange, and  makes buyers and sellers mutually dependent, because none of them possesses  the object of his own wants, and each holds in his hand the object of another’s  wants. Besides these material differences of their use-values, there is  only one other difference between commodities, namely, that between their  bodily form and the form into which they are converted by sale, the difference  between commodities and money. And consequently the owners of commodities  are distinguishable only as sellers, those who own commodities, and buyers,  those who own money.    ","Contradictions

The seller therefore  pockets a surplus-value of 10. But after he has sold he becomes a buyer.  A third owner of commodities comes to him now as seller, who in this capacity  also enjoys the privilege of selling his commodities 10% too dear. Our  friend gained 10 as a seller only to lose it again as a buyer.   The net result is, that all owners of commodities sell their goods to one  another at 10% above their value, which comes precisely to the same as  if they sold them at their true value. Such a general and nominal rise  of prices has the same effect as if the values had been expressed in weight  of silver instead of in weight of gold.

The existence of such a class is inexplicable from the standpoint  we have so far reached, viz., that of simple circulation. But let us anticipate.  The money with which such a class is constantly making purchases, must  constantly flow into their pockets, without any exchange, gratis, by might  or right, from the pockets of the commodity-owners themselves. To  sell commodities above their value to such a class, is only to crib back  again a part of the money previously given to it.   The towns of Asia Minor thus paid a yearly money tribute to ancient Rome.  With this money Rome purchased from them commodities, and purchased them  too dear. The provincials cheated the Romans, and thus got back from their  conquerors, in the course of trade, a portion of the tribute. Yet, for  all that, the conquered were the really cheated. Their goods were still  paid for with their own money. That is not the way to get rich or to create  surplus-value.  ","Contradictions

Before the exchange we had £40 worth of wine in the hands of A, and  £50 worth of corn in those of B, a total value of £90. After  the exchange we have still the same total value of £90. The value  in circulation has not increased by one iota, it is only distributed differently  between A and B. What is a loss of value to B is surplus-value to A; what  is “minus” to one is “plus” to the other.

Hence Aristotle: “since chrematistic  is a double science, one part belonging to commerce, the other to economic,  the latter being necessary and praiseworthy, the former based on circulation  and with justice disapproved (for it is not based on Nature, but on mutual  cheating), therefore the usurer is most rightly hated, because money itself  is the source of his gain, and is not used for the purposes for which it  was invented. For it originated for the exchange of commodities, but interest  makes out of money, more money. Hence its name ( ","Contradictions

614,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch05.htm,"We have shown that surplus-value cannot be created by circulation,  and, therefore, that in its formation, something must take place in the  background, which is not apparent in the circulation itself.   But can surplus-value possibly originate anywhere else than in circulation,  which is the sum total of all the mutual relations of commodity-owners,  as far as they are determined by their commodities? Apart from circulation,  the commodity-owner is in relation only with his own commodity. So far  as regards value, that relation is limited to this, that the commodity  contains a quantity of his own labour, that quantity being measured by  a definite social standard. This quantity is expressed by the value of  the commodity, and since the value is reckoned in money of account, this  quantity is also expressed by the price, which we will suppose to be £10.  But his labour is not represented both by the value of the commodity, and  by a surplus over that value, not by a price of 10 that is also a price  of 11, not by a value that is greater than itself. The commodity owner  can, by his labour, create value, but not self-expanding value. He can  increase the value of his commodity, by adding fresh labour, and therefore  more value to the value in hand, by making, for instance, leather into  boots. The same material has now more value, because it contains  a greater quantity of labour. The boots have therefore more value than  the leather, but the value of the leather remains what it was; it has not  expanded itself, has not, during the making of the boots, annexed surplus-value.  It is therefore impossible that outside the sphere of circulation, a producer  of commodities can, without coming into contact with other commodity-owners,  expand value, and consequently convert money or commodities into capital.

From the foregoing investigation,  the reader will see that this statement only means that the formation of  capital must be possible even though the price and value of a commodity  be the same; for its formation cannot be attributed to any deviation of  the one from the other. If prices actually differ from values, we must,  first of all, reduce the former to the latter, in other words, treat the  difference as accidental in order that the phenomena may be observed in  their purity, and our observations not interfered with by disturbing circumstances  that have nothing to do with the process in question. We know, moreover,  that this reduction is no mere scientific process. The continual oscillations  in prices, their rising and falling, compensate each other, and reduce  themselves to an average price, which is their hidden regulator. It forms  the guiding star of the merchant or the manufacturer in every undertaking  that requires time. He knows that when a long period of time is taken,  commodities are sold neither over nor under, but at their average price.  If therefore he thought about the matter at all, he would formulate the  problem of the formation of capital as follows: How can we account for  the origin of capital on the supposition that prices are regulated by the  average price, i. e., ultimately by the value of the commodities? I say  “ultimately,” because average prices do not directly coincide with the  values of commodities, as Adam Smith, Ricardo, and others believe.","Contradictions

Just as little can it originate in the second act of circulation, the re-sale of the commodity, which does no more than transform the article from its  bodily form back again into its money-form. The change must, therefore,  take place in the commodity bought by the first act, M-C, but not in its  value, for equivalents are exchanged, and the commodity is paid for at  its full value. We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion that the change  originates in the use-value, as such, of the commodity, i.e., in its consumption.  In order to be able to extract value from the consumption of a commodity,  our friend, Moneybags, must be so lucky as to find, within the sphere of  circulation, in the market, a commodity, whose use-value possesses the  peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption,  therefore, is itself an embodiment of labour, and, consequently, a creation  of value. The possessor of money does find on the market such a special  commodity in capacity for labour or labour-power.  ","The

The exchange of commodities of itself implies no other relations  of dependence than those which result from its own nature. On this assumption,  labour-power can appear upon the market as a commodity, only if, and so  far as, its possessor, the individual whose labour-power it is, offers  it for sale, or sells it, as a commodity. In order that he may be able  to do this, he must have it at his disposal, must be the untrammelled owner  of his capacity for labour, i.e., of his person.  ","The

No boots can be made without leather. He requires also  the means of subsistence. Nobody — not even “a musician of the future”   — can live upon future products, or upon use-values in an unfinished state;  and ever since the first moment of his appearance on the world’s stage,  man always has been, and must still be a consumer, both before and while  he is producing. In a society where all products assume the form of commodities,  these commodities must be sold after they have been produced, it is only  after their sale that they can serve in satisfying the requirements of  their producer.

And for the present it  interests us just as little. We cling to the fact theoretically, as he  does practically. One thing, however, is clear — Nature does not produce  on the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other men possessing  nothing but their own labour-power. This relation has no natural basis,  neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods.  It is clearly the result of a past historical development, the product  of many economic revolutions, of the extinction of a whole series of older  forms of social production.  ","The
Buying and Selling of Labour-Power"
655,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"So, too, the economic categories, already discussed by us, bear  the stamp of history. Definite historical conditions are necessary that  a product may become a commodity. It must not be produced as the immediate  means of subsistence of the producer himself. Had we gone further, and  inquired under what circumstances all, or even the majority of products  take the form of commodities, we should have found that this can only happen  with production of a very specific kind, capitalist production. Such an  inquiry, however, would have been foreign to the analysis of commodities.  Production and circulation of commodities can take place, although the  great mass of the objects produced are intended for the immediate requirements  of their producers, are not turned into commodities, and consequently social  production is not yet by a long way dominated in its length and breadth  by exchange-value. The appearance of products as commodities pre-supposes  such a development of the social division of labour, that the separation  of use-value from exchange-value, a separation which first begins with barter,  must already have been completed. But such a degree of development is common  to many forms of society, which in other respects present the most varying  historical features. On the other hand, if we consider money, its existence  implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities. The particular  functions of money which it performs, either as the mere equivalent of  commodities, or as means of circulation, or means of payment, as hoard  or as universal money, point, according to the extent and relative preponderance  of the one function or the other, to very different stages in the process  of social production. Yet we know by experience that a circulation of commodities  relatively primitive, suffices for the production of all these forms. Otherwise  with capital. The historical conditions of its existence are by no means  given with the mere circulation of money and commodities. It can spring  into life, only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence  meets in the market with the free labourer selling his labour-power. And  this one historical condition comprises a world’s history. Capital, therefore,  announces from its first appearance a new epoch in the process of social  production.  ","The

656,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"We must now examine more closely this peculiar commodity, labour-power.  Like all others it has a value.  How is that value  determined?    ","The
Buying and Selling of Labour-Power"
657,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"The value of labour-power is determined, as in the case of every  other commodity, by the labour-time necessary for the production, and consequently  also the reproduction, of this special article. So far as it has value,  it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average labour of  society incorporated in it. Labour-power exists only as a capacity, or  power of the living individual. Its production consequently pre-supposes  his existence. Given the individual, the production of labour-power consists  in his reproduction of himself or his maintenance. For his maintenance  he requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence. Therefore the  labour-time requisite for the production of labour-power reduces itself  to that necessary for the production of those means of subsistence; in  other words, the value of labour-power is the value of the means of subsistence  necessary for the maintenance of the labourer. Labour-power, however, becomes  a reality only by its exercise; it sets itself in action only by working.  But thereby a definite quantity of human muscle, nerve, brain, &c.,  is wasted, and these require to be restored. This increased  expenditure demands a larger income.   In contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities, there  enters into the determination of the value of labour-power a historical  and moral element. Nevertheless, in a given country, at a given period,  the average quantity of the means of subsistence necessary for the labourer  is practically known.     ","The

This amount varies according to the more or less complicated character  of the labour-power. The expenses of this education (excessively small in  the case of ordinary labour-power), enter pro tanto into the total value  spent in its production.  ","The
Buying and Selling of Labour-Power"
660,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,The value of labour-power resolves itself into the value of a  definite quantity of the means of subsistence. It therefore varies with  the value of these means or with the quantity of labour requisite for their  production.  ,"The
Buying and Selling of Labour-Power"
661,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"Some of the means of subsistence, such as food and fuel, are consumed  daily, and a fresh supply must be provided daily. Others such as clothes  and furniture last for longer periods and require to be replaced only at  longer intervals. One article must be bought or paid for daily, another  weekly, another quarterly, and so on. But in whatever way the sum total  of these outlays may be spread over the year, they must be covered by the  average income, taking one day with another. If the total of the commodities  required daily for the production of labour-power = A, and those required  weekly = B, and those required quarterly = C, and so on, the daily average  of these commodities = (365A + 52B + 4C + &c) / 365. Suppose that in  this mass of commodities requisite for the average day there are embodied  6 hours of social labour, then there is incorporated daily in labour-power  half a day’s average social labour, in other words, half a day’s labour  is requisite for the daily production of labour-power. This quantity of  labour forms the value of a day’s labour-power or the value of the labour-power  daily reproduced. If half a day’s average social labour is incorporated  in three shillings, then three shillings is the price corresponding to  the value of a day’s labour-power. If its owner therefore offers it for  sale at three shillings a day, its selling price is equal to its value,  and according to our supposition, our friend Moneybags, who is intent upon  converting his three shillings into capital, pays this value.

662,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"The minimum limit of the value of labour-power is determined by  the value of the commodities, without the daily supply of which the labourer  cannot renew his vital energy, consequently by the value of those means  of subsistence that are physically indispensable. If the price of labour-power  fall to this minimum, it falls below its value, since under such circumstances  it can be maintained and developed only in a crippled state. But the value  of every commodity is determined by the labour-time requisite to turn it  out so as to be of normal quality.     ","The

663,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"It is a very cheap sort of sentimentality which declares this  method of determining the value of labour-power, a method prescribed by  the very nature of the case, to be a brutal method, and which wails with  Rossi that, “To comprehend capacity for labour (puissance de travail) at  the same time that we make abstraction from the means of subsistence  of the labourers during the process of production, is to comprehend a phantom  (être de raison). When we speak of labour, or capacity for labour,  we speak at the same time of the labourer and his means of subsistence,  of labourer and wages.”    ","The
Buying and Selling of Labour-Power"
664,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm,"One consequence of the peculiar nature of labour-power as a commodity  is, that its use-value does not, on the conclusion of the contract between  the buyer and seller, immediately pass into the hands of the former. Its  value, like that of every other commodity, is already fixed before it goes  into circulation, since a definite quantity of social labour has been spent  upon it; but its use-value consists in the subsequent exercise of its force.  The alienation of labour-power and its actual appropriation by the buyer,  its employment as a use-value, are separated by an interval of time. But  in those cases in which the formal alienation by sale of the use-value  of a commodity, is not simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer,  the money of the latter usually functions as means of payment.   Nevertheless, whether money serves as a means of purchase or as a means  of payment, this makes no alteration in the nature of the exchange of commodities.  The price of the labour-power is fixed by the contract, although it is  not realised till later, like the rent of a house. The labour-power is  sold, although it is only paid for at a later period. It will, therefore,  be useful, for a clear comprehension of the relation of the parties, to  assume provisionally, that the possessor of labour-power, on the occasion  of each sale, immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for  it.

The use-value  which the former gets in exchange, manifests itself only in the actual  utilisation, in the consumption of the labour-power. The money-owner buys  everything necessary for this purpose, such as raw material, in the market,  and pays for it at its full value. The consumption of labour-power is at  one and the same time the production of commodities and of surplus-value.  The consumption of labour-power is completed, as in the case of every other  commodity, outside the limits of the market or of the sphere of circulation.  Accompanied by Mr. Moneybags and by the possessor of labour-power, we therefore  take leave for a time of this noisy sphere, where everything takes place  on the surface and in view of all men, and follow them both into the hidden  abode of production, on whose threshold there stares us in the face “No  admittance except on business.” Here we shall see, not only how capital  produces, but how capital is produced. We shall at last force the secret  of profit making.  ","The

There alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and  Bentham. Freedom, because both buyer and seller of a commodity, say of  labour-power, are constrained only by their own free will. They contract  as free agents, and the agreement they come to, is but the form in which  they give legal expression to their common will. Equality, because each  enters into relation with the other, as with a simple owner of commodities,  and they exchange equivalent for equivalent. Property, because each disposes  only of what is his own. And Bentham, because each looks only to himself.  The only force that brings them together and puts them in relation with  each other, is the selfishness, the gain and the private interests of each.  Each looks to himself only, and no one troubles himself about the rest,  and just because they do so, do they all, in accordance with the pre-established  harmony of things, or under the auspices of an all-shrewd providence, work  together to their mutual advantage, for the common weal and in the interest  of all.

He, who before was the money-owner, now strides  in front as capitalist; the possessor of labour-power follows as his labourer.  The one with an air of importance, smirking, intent on business; the other,  timid and holding back, like one who is bringing his own hide to market  and has nothing to expect but — a hiding.  ","The

Wherever free labour is the rule,  the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract. In some States,  particularly in Mexico (before the American Civil War, also in the territories  taken from Mexico, and also, as a matter of fact, in the Danubian provinces  till the revolution effected by Kusa), slavery is hidden under the form  of peonage. By means of advances, repayable in labour, which are  handed down from generation to generation, not only the individual labourer,  but his family, become, de facto, the property of other persons  and their families. Juarez abolished peonage. The so-called Emperor  Maximilian re-established it by a decree, which, in the House of Representatives  at Washington, was aptly denounced as a decree for the re-introduction  of slavery into Mexico. “I may make over to another the use, for a limited  time, of my particular bodily and mental aptitudes and capabilities; because  in consequence of this restriction, they are impressed with a character  of alienation with regard to me as a whole. But by the alienation of all  my labour-time and the whole of my work, I should be converting the substance  itself, in other words, my general activity and reality, my person, into  the property of another.” (Hegel, “Philosophie des Rechts.” Berlin, 1840,  p. 104, § 67.)","The

In London there are  two sorts of bakers, the “full priced,” who sell bread at its full value,  and the “undersellers,” who sell it under its value. The latter class comprises  more than three-fourths of the total number of bakers. (p. xxxii in the  Report of H. S. Tremenheere, commissioner to examine into “the grievances  complained of by the journeymen bakers,” &c., Lond. 1862.) The undersellers,  almost without exception, sell bread adulterated with alum, soap, pearl  ashes, chalk, Derbyshire stone-dust, and such like agreeable nourishing  and wholesome ingredients. (See the above cited Blue book, as also the  report of “the committee of 1855 on the adulteration of bread,” and Dr.  Hassall’s “Adulterations Detected,” 2nd Ed. Lond. 1861.) Sir John Gordon  stated before the committee of 1855, that “in consequence of these adulterations,  the poor man, who lives on two pounds of bread a day, does not now get  one fourth part of nourishing matter, let alone the deleterious effects  on his health.” Tremenheere states (l.c., p. xlviii), as the reason, why  a very large part of the working-class, although well aware of this adulteration,  nevertheless accept the alum, stone-dust, &c., as part of their purchase:  that it is for them “a matter of necessity to take from their baker or  from the chandler’s shop, such bread as they choose to supply.” As they  are not paid their wages before the end of the week, they in their turn  are unable “to pay for the bread consumed by their families, during the  week, before the end of the week,” and Tremenheere adds on the evidence  of witnesses, “it is notorious that bread composed of those mixtures, is  made expressly for sale in this manner.” In many English and still more  Scotch agricultural districts, wages are paid fortnightly and even monthly;  with such long intervals between the payments, the agricultural labourer  is obliged to buy on credit.... He must pay higher prices, and is in fact  tied to the shop which gives him credit. Thus at Horningham in Wilts, for  example, where the wages are monthly, the same flour that he could buy  elsewhere at 1s 10d per stone, costs him 2s 4d per stone. (“Sixth Report”   on “Public Health” by “The Medical Officer of the Privy Council, &c.,  1864,” p.264.) “The block printers of Paisley and Kilmarnock enforced,  by a strike, fortnightly, instead of monthly payment of wages.” (“Reports  of the Inspectors of Factories for 31st Oct., 1853,” p. 34.) As a further  pretty result of the credit given by the workmen to the capitalist, we  may refer to the method current in many English coal mines, where the labourer  is not paid till the end of the month, and in the meantime, receives sums  on account from the capitalist, often in goods for which the miner is obliged  to pay more than the market price (Truck-system). “It is a common practice  with the coal masters to pay once a month, and advance cash to their workmen  at the end of each intermediate week. The cash is given in the shop” (i.e.,  the Tommy shop which belongs to the master); “the men take it on one side  and lay it out on the other.” (“Children’s Employment Commission, III.  Report,” Lond. 1864, p. 38, n. 192.)","The

690,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"The capitalist buys labour-power in order to use it;  and labour-power in use is labour itself. The purchaser of labour-power  consumes it by setting the seller of it to work. By working, the latter  becomes actually, what before he only was potentially, labour-power in  action, a labourer. In order that his labour may re-appear in a commodity,  he must, before all things, expend it on something useful, on something  capable of satisfying a want of some sort. Hence, what the capitalist sets  the labourer to produce, is a particular use-value, a specified article.  The fact that the production of use-values, or goods, is carried on under  the control of a capitalist and on his behalf, does not alter the general  character of that production. We shall, therefore, in the first place,  have to consider the labour-process independently of the particular form  it assumes under given social conditions.  ","The
Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
691,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"Labour is, in the first place, a process in which both man and  Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates,  and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature. He opposes  himself to Nature as one of her own forces, setting in motion arms and  legs, head and hands, the natural forces of his body, in order to appropriate  Nature’s productions in a form adapted to his own wants. By thus acting  on the external world and changing it, he at the same time changes his  own nature. He develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act in  obedience to his sway. We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive  forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal. An immeasurable interval  of time separates the state of things in which a man brings  his labour-power to market for sale as a commodity, from that state in  which human labour was still in its first instinctive stage. We pre-suppose  labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts  operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many  an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the  worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises  his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end  of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination  of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form  in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his  own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate  his will. And this subordination is no mere momentary act. Besides the  exertion of the bodily organs, the process demands that, during the whole  operation, the workman’s will be steadily in consonance with his purpose.  This means close attention. The less he is attracted by the nature of the  work, and the mode in which it is carried on, and the less, therefore,  he enjoys it as something which gives play to his bodily and mental powers,  the more close his attention is forced to be.

All those things which labour  merely separates from immediate connexion with their environment, are subjects  of labour spontaneously provided by Nature. Such are fish which we catch  and take from their element, water, timber which we fell in the virgin  forest, and ores which we extract from their veins. If, on the other hand,  the subject of labour has, so to say, been filtered through previous labour,  we call it raw material; such is ore already extracted and ready for washing.  All raw material is the subject of labour, but not every subject of labour  is raw material: it can only become so, after it has undergone some alteration  by means of labour.         ","The

He makes use of the mechanical,  physical, and chemical properties of some substances in order to make other  substances subservient to his aims.  Instruments  of labour not only supply a standard of the degree of development  to which human labour has attained, but they are also indicators of the  social conditions under which that labour is carried on. Among the instruments  of labour, those of a mechanical nature, which, taken as a whole, we may  call the bone and muscles of production, offer much more decided characteristics  of a given epoch of production, than those which, like pipes, tubs, baskets,  jars, &c., serve only to hold the materials for labour, which latter  class, we may in a general way, call the vascular system of production.  The latter first begins to play an important part in the chemical industries.  ","The

695,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"In a wider sense we may include among the instruments of labour,  in addition to those things that are used for directly transferring labour  to its subject, and which therefore, in one way or another, serve as conductors  of activity, all such objects as are necessary for carrying on the labour-process.  These do not enter directly into the process, but without them it is either  impossible for it to take place at all, or possible only to a partial extent.  Once more we find the earth to be a universal instrument of this sort,  for it furnishes a locus standi to the labourer and a field of employment  for his activity. Among instruments that are the result of previous labour  and also belong to this class, we find workshops, canals, roads, and so  forth.  ","The

The process disappears in the  product, the latter is a use-value, Nature’s material adapted by a change  of form to the wants of man. Labour has incorporated itself with its subject:  the former is materialised, the latter transformed.

Such  is seed in agriculture. Animals and plants, which we are accustomed to  consider as products of Nature, are in their present form, not only products  of, say last year’s labour, but the result of a gradual transformation,  continued through many generations, under man’s superintendence, and by  means of his labour. But in the great majority of cases, instruments of  labour show even to the most superficial observer, traces of the labour  of past ages.     ","The

700,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"Raw material may either form the principal substance of a product,  or it may enter into its formation only as an accessory. An accessory may  be consumed by the instruments of labour, as coal under a boiler, oil by  a wheel, hay by draft-horses, or it may be mixed with the raw material  in order to produce some modification thereof, as chlorine into unbleached  linen, coal with iron, dye-stuff with wool, or again, it may help to carry  on the work itself, as in the case of the materials used for heating and  lighting workshops. The distinction between principal substance and accessory  vanishes in the true chemical industries, because there none of the raw  material re-appears, in its original composition, in the substance of the  product.

One and the same product may therefore  serve as raw material in very different processes. Corn, for example, is  a raw material for millers, starch-manufacturers, distillers, and cattlebreeders.  It also enters as raw material into its own production in the shape of  seed; coal, too, is at the same time the product of, and a means of production  in, coal-mining.  ","The

On the other hand, labour may give us its product in  such a form, that we can use it only as raw material, as is the case with cotton,  thread, and yarn. Such a raw material, though itself a product, may have  to go through a whole series of different processes: in each of these in  turn, it serves, with constantly varying form, as raw material, until the  last process of the series leaves it a perfect product, ready for individual  consumption, or for use as an instrument of labour.  ","The
Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
704,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"Hence we see, that whether a use-value is to be regarded as raw  material, as instrument of labour, or as product, this is determined entirely  by its function in the labour-process, by the position it there occupies:  as this varies, so does its character.

Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
705,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"Whenever therefore a product enters as a means of production into  a new labour-process, it thereby loses its character of product, and becomes  a mere factor in the process. A spinner treats spindles only as implements  for spinning, and flax only as the material that he spins. Of course it  is impossible to spin without material and spindles; and therefore the  existence of these things as products, at the commencement of the spinning  operation, must be presumed: but in the process itself, the fact that they  are products of previous labour, is a matter of utter indifference; just  as in the digestive process, it is of no importance whatever, that bread  is the produce of the previous labour of the farmer, the miller, and the  baker. On the contrary, it is generally by their imperfections as products,  that the means of production in any process assert themselves in their  character of products. A blunt knife or weak thread forcibly remind us  of Mr. A., the cutler, or Mr. B., the spinner. In the finished product  the labour by means of which it has acquired its useful qualities is not  palpable, has apparently vanished.  ","The

Living labour must seize upon these things and rouse them  from their death-sleep, change them from mere possible use-values into  real and effective ones. Bathed in the fire of labour, appropriated as  part and parcel of labour’s organism, and, as it were, made alive for the  performance of their functions in the process, they are in truth consumed,  but consumed with a purpose, as elementary constituents of new use-values,  of new products, ever ready as means of subsistence for individual consumption,  or as means of production for some new labour-process.

Such productive consumption is distinguished from individual consumption  by this, that the latter uses up products, as means of subsistence for  the living individual; the former, as means whereby alone, labour, the  labour-power of the living individual, is enabled to act.

But, just as in the beginning, the only participators  in the labour-process were man and the earth, which latter exists independently  of man, so even now we still employ in the process many means of production,  provided directly by Nature, that do not represent any combination of natural  substances with human labour.

It was, therefore, not necessary to represent our labourer  in connexion with other labourers; man and his labour on one side, Nature  and its materials on the other, sufficed. As the taste of the porridge  does not tell you who grew the oats, no more does this simple process tell  you of itself what are the social conditions under which it is taking place,  whether under the slave-owner’s brutal lash, or the anxious eye of the  capitalist, whether Cincinnatus carries it on in tilling his modest farm  or a savage in killing wild animals with stones.

We left him just  after he had purchased, in the open market, all the necessary factors of  the labour process; its objective factors, the means of production, as  well as its subjective factor, labour-power. With the keen eye of an expert,  he has selected the means of production and the kind of labour-power best  adapted to his particular trade, be it spinning, bootmaking, or any  other kind. He then proceeds to consume the commodity, the labour-power  that he has just bought, by causing the labourer, the impersonation of  that labour-power, to consume the means of production by his labour. The  general character of the labour-process is evidently not changed by the  fact, that the labourer works for the capitalist instead of for himself;  moreover, the particular methods and operations employed in bootmaking  or spinning are not immediately changed by the intervention of the capitalist.  He must begin by taking the labour-power as he finds it in the market,  and consequently be satisfied with labour of such a kind as would be found  in the period immediately preceding the rise of capitalists. Changes in  the methods of production by the subordination of labour to capital, can  take place only at a later period, and therefore will have to be treated  of in a later chapter.  ","The
Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
712,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"The labour-process, turned into the process by which the capitalist  consumes labour-power, exhibits two characteristic phenomena. First, the  labourer works under the control of the capitalist to whom his labour belongs;  the capitalist taking good care that the work is done in a proper manner,  and that the means of production are used with intelligence, so that there  is no unnecessary waste of raw material, and no wear and tear of the implements  beyond what is necessarily caused by the work.     ","The

713,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"Secondly, the product is the property of the capitalist and not  that of the labourer, its immediate producer. Suppose that a capitalist  pays for a day’s labour-power at its value; then the right to use that  power for a day belongs to him, just as much as the right to use any other  commodity, such as a horse that he has hired for the day. To the purchaser  of a commodity belongs its use, and the seller of labour-power, by giving  his labour, does no more, in reality, than part with the use-value that  he has sold. From the instant he steps into the workshop, the use-value  of his labour-power, and therefore also its use, which is labour, belongs  to the capitalist. By the purchase of labour-power, the capitalist incorporates  labour, as a living ferment, with the lifeless constituents of the product.  From his point of view, the labour-process is nothing more than the consumption  of the commodity purchased, i. e., of labour-power; but this consumption  cannot be effected except by supplying the labour-power with the means  of production. The labour-process is a process between things that the  capitalist has purchased, things that have become his property. The product  of this process belongs, therefore, to him, just as much as does the wine  which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar.   ","The

But, although boots are, in one sense, the basis of  all social progress, and our capitalist is a decided “progressist,” yet  he does not manufacture boots for their own sake. Use-value is, by no means,  the thing “qu’on aime pour lui-même” in the production of commodities.  Use-values are only produced by capitalists, because, and in so far as,  they are the material substratum, the depositories of exchange-value. Our  capitalist has two objects in view: in the first place, he wants to produce  a use-value that has a value in exchange, that is to say, an article destined  to be sold, a commodity; and secondly, he desires to produce a commodity  whose value shall be greater than the sum of the values of the commodities  used in its production, that is, of the means of production and the labour-power,  that he purchased with his good money in the open market. His aim is to  produce not only a use-value, but a commodity also; not only use-value,  but value; not only value, but at the same time surplus-value.     ","The

Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
720,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"We know that the value of each commodity is determined by the  quantity of labour expended on and materialised in it, by the working-time  necessary, under given social conditions, for its production. This rule  also holds good in the case of the product that accrued to our capitalist,  as the result of the labour-process carried on for him. Assuming this product  to be 10 lbs. of yarn, our first step is to calculate the quantity of labour  realised in it.  ","The
Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
721,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"For spinning the yarn, raw material is required; suppose in this  case 10 lbs. of cotton. We have no need at present to investigate the value  of this cotton, for our capitalist has, we will assume, bought it at its  full value, say of ten shillings. In this price the labour required for  the production of the cotton is already expressed in terms of the average  labour of society. We will further assume that the wear and tear of the  spindle, which, for our present purpose, may represent all other instruments  of labour employed, amounts to the value of 2s. If, then, twenty-four hours’  labour, or two working-days, are required to produce the quantity of gold  represented by twelve shillings, we have here, to begin with, two days’  labour already incorporated in the yarn.

By the general law of value, if the value  of 40 lbs. of yarn = the value of 40 lbs. of cotton + the value of a whole  spindle, i. e., if the same working-time is required to produce  the commodities on either side of this equation, then 10 lbs. of yarn are  an equivalent for 10 lbs. of cotton, together with one-fourth of a spindle.  In the case we are considering the same working-time is materialised in  the 10 lbs. of yarn on the one hand, and in the 10 lbs. of cotton and the  fraction of a spindle on the other. Therefore, whether value appears in  cotton, in a spindle, or in yarn, makes no difference in the amount of  that value. The spindle and cotton, instead of resting quietly side by  side, join together in the process, their forms are altered, and they are  turned into yarn; but their value is no more affected by this fact than  it would be if they had been simply exchanged for their equivalent in yarn.

The whole of the labour  in the yarn is past labour; and it is a matter of no importance that the  operations necessary for the production of its constituent elements were  carried on at times which, referred to the present, are more remote than  the final operation of spinning. If a definite quantity of labour,  say thirty days, is requisite to build a house, the total amount of labour  incorporated in it is not altered by the fact that the work of the last  day is done twenty-nine days later than that of the first. Therefore the  labour contained in the raw material and the instruments of labour can  be treated just as if it were labour expended in an earlier stage of the  spinning process, before the labour of actual spinning commenced.

First, the cotton  and spindle must concur in the production of a use-value; they must in  the present case become yarn. Value is independent of the particular use-value  by which it is borne, but it must be embodied in a use-value of some kind.  Secondly, the time occupied in the labour of production must not exceed  the time really necessary under the given social conditions of the case.  Therefore, if no more than 1 lb. of cotton be requisite to spin 1 lb.  of yarn, care must be taken that no more than this weight of cotton is  consumed in the production of 1 lb. of yarn; and similarly with regard  to the spindle. Though the capitalist have a hobby, and use a gold instead  of a steel spindle, yet the only labour that counts for anything in the  value of the yarn is that which would be required to produce a steel spindle,  because no more is necessary under the given social conditions.

","The

728,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"We have now to consider this labour under a very different aspect  from that which it had during the labour-process; there, we viewed it solely  as that particular kind of human activity which changes cotton into yarn;  there, the more the labour was suited to the work, the better the yarn,  other circumstances remaining the same. The labour of the spinner was then  viewed as specifically different from other kinds of productive labour,  different on the one hand in its special aim, viz., spinning, different,  on the other hand, in the special character of its operations, in the special  nature of its means of production and in the special use-value of its product.  For the operation of spinning, cotton and spindles are a necessity, but  for making rifled cannon they would be of no use whatever. Here, on the  contrary, where we consider the labour of the spinner only so far as it  is value-creating, i.e., a source of value, his labour differs  in no respect from the labour of the man who bores cannon, or (what  here more nearly concerns us), from the labour of the cotton-planter and  spindle-maker incorporated in the means of production. It is solely by  reason of this identity, that cotton planting, spindle making and spinning,  are capable of forming the component parts differing only quantitatively  from each other, of one whole, namely, the value of the yarn. Here, we  have nothing more to do with the quality, the nature and the specific character  of the labour, but merely with its quantity. And this simply requires to  be calculated. We proceed upon the assumption that spinning is simple,  unskilled labour, the average labour of a given state of society. Hereafter  we shall see that the contrary assumption would make no difference.  ","The

At the  end of one hour’s spinning, that act is represented by a definite quantity  of yarn; in other words, a definite quantity of labour, namely that of  one hour, has become embodied in the cotton. We say labour, i.e.,  the expenditure of his vital force by the spinner, and not spinning labour,  because the special work of spinning counts here, only so far as it is  the expenditure of labour-power in general, and not in so far as it is  the specific work of the spinner.

If under normal,  i.e., average social conditions of production, a pounds of  cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hour’s labour,  then a day’s labour does not count as 12 hours’ labour unless 12 a  pounds of cotton have been made into 12 b pounds of yarn; for in  the creation of value, the time that is socially necessary alone counts.

The raw material serves now  merely as an absorbent of a definite quantity of labour. By this absorption  it is in fact changed into yarn, because it is spun, because labour-power  in the form of spinning is added to it; but the product, the yarn, is now  nothing more than a measure of the labour absorbed by the cotton. If in  one hour 1 2/3 lbs. of cotton can be spun into 1 2/3 lbs. of yarn, then  10 lbs. of yarn indicate the absorption of 6 hours’ labour. Definite quantities  of product, these quantities being determined by experience, now represent  nothing but definite quantities of labour, definite masses of crystallised  labour-time.

If now our spinner by working for one hour, can convert 1 2/3 lbs. of cotton  into 1 2/3 lbs. of yarn,  it follows that in six  hours he will convert 10 lbs. of cotton into 10 lbs. of yarn.

The price of the yarn is fifteen shillings,  and fifteen shillings were spent in the open market upon the constituent  elements of the product, or, what amounts to the same thing, upon the factors  of the labour-process; ten shillings were paid for the cotton, two shillings  for the substance of the spindle worn away, and three shillings for the  labour-power. The swollen value of the yarn is of no avail, for it is merely  the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton, the spindle, and  the labour-power: out of such a simple addition of existing  values, no surplus-value can possibly arise.

But here we are dealing with exchange-value. The capitalist paid to the  labourer a value of 3 shillings, and the labourer gave him back an exact  equivalent in the value of 3 shillings, added by him to the cotton: he  gave him value for value. Our friend, up to this time so purse-proud, suddenly  assumes the modest demeanour of his own workman, and exclaims: “Have  I myself not worked? Have I not performed the labour of superintendence  and of overlooking the spinner? And does not this labour, too, create value?”  His overlooker and his manager try to hide their smiles. Meanwhile, after  a hearty laugh, he re-assumes his usual mien. Though he chanted to us the  whole creed of the economists, in reality, he says, he would not give a  brass farthing for it.

Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value"
738,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm,"Let us examine the matter more closely. The value of a day’s labour-power  amounts to 3 shillings, because on our assumption half a day’s labour is  embodied in that quantity of labour-power, i.e., because the means  of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labour-power,  cost half a day’s labour. But the past labour that is embodied in the labour-power,  and the living labour that it can call into action; the daily cost of maintaining  it, and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things.  The former determines the exchange-value of the labour-power, the latter  is its use-value. The fact that half a day’s labour is necessary to keep  the labourer alive during 24 hours, does not in any way prevent him from  working a whole day. Therefore, the value of labour-power, and the value  which that labour-power creates in the labour-process, are two entirely  different magnitudes; and this difference of the two values was what the  capitalist had in view, when he was purchasing the labour-power. The useful  qualities that labour-power possesses, and by virtue of which it makes  yarn or boots, were to him nothing more than a conditio sine qua non; for  in order to create value, labour must be expended in a useful manner. What  really influenced him was the specific use-value which this commodity possesses  of being a source not only of value, but of more value than it has itself.  This is the special service that the capitalist expects from labour-power,  and in this transaction he acts in accordance with the “eternal laws” of  the exchange of commodities. The seller of labour-power, like the seller  of any other commodity, realises its exchange-value, and parts with its  use-value. He cannot take the one without giving the other. The use-value  of labour-power, or in other words, labour, belongs just as little to its  seller, as the use-value of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer  who has sold it. The owner of the money has paid the value of a day’s labour-power;  his, therefore, is the use of it for a day; a day’s labour belongs to him.  The circumstance, that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labour-power  costs only half a day’s labour, while on the other hand the very same labour-power  can work during a whole day, that consequently the value which its use  during one day creates, is double what he pays for that use, this circumstance  is, without doubt, a piece of good luck for the buyer, but by no means  an injury to the seller.

The labourer therefore finds, in the workshop, the  means of production necessary for working, not only during six, but during  twelve hours. Just as during the six hours’ process our 10 lbs. of cotton  absorbed six hours’ labour, and became 10 lbs. of yarn, so now, 20 lbs.  of cotton will absorb 12 hours’ labour and be changed into 20 lbs. of yarn.  Let us now examine the product of this prolonged process. There is now  materialised in this 20 lbs. of yarn the labour of five days, of which  four days are due to the cotton and the lost steel of the spindle, the  remaining day having been absorbed by the cotton during the spinning process.  Expressed in gold, the labour of five days is thirty shillings. This is  therefore the price of the 20 lbs. of yarn, giving, as before, eighteenpence  as the price of a pound. But the sum of the values of the commodities that  entered into the process amounts to 27 shillings. The value of the yarn  is 30 shillings. Therefore the value of the product is 1/9 greater than  the value advanced for its production; 27 shillings have been transformed  into 30 shillings; a surplus-value of 3 shillings has been created. The  trick has at last succeeded; money has been converted into capital.  ","The

Equivalent  has been exchanged for equivalent. For the capitalist as buyer paid for  each commodity, for the cotton, the spindle and the labour-power, its full  value. He then did what is done by every purchaser of commodities; he consumed  their use-value. The consumption of the labour-power, which was also the  process of producing commodities, resulted in 20 lbs. of yarn, having a  value of 30 shillings. The capitalist, formerly a buyer, now returns to  market as a seller, of commodities. He sells his yarn at eighteenpence  a pound, which is its exact value. Yet for all that he withdraws 3 shillings  more from circulation than he originally threw into it. This metamorphosis,  this conversion of money into capital, takes place both within the sphere  of circulation and also outside it; within the circulation, because conditioned  by the purchase of the labour-power in the market; outside the circulation,  because what is done within it is only a stepping-stone to the production  of surplus-value, a process which is entirely confined to the sphere of  production.

Here we contemplate  the labour as producing a particular article; we view it under its qualitative  aspect alone, with regard to its end and aim. But viewed as a value-creating  process, the same labour-process presents itself under its quantitative  aspect alone. Here it is a question merely of the time occupied by the  labourer in doing the work; of the period during which the labour-power  is usefully expended. Here, the commodities that take part in the process,  do not count any longer as necessary adjuncts of labour-power in the production  of a definite, useful object. They count merely as depositories of so much  absorbed or materialised labour; that labour, whether previously embodied  in the means of production, or incorporated in them for the first time  during the process by the action of labour-power, counts in either case  only according to its duration; it amounts to so many hours or days as  the case may be.

The consequences of this are various. In the first place, it becomes necessary  that the labour should be carried on under normal conditions. If a self-acting  mule is the implement in general use for spinning, it would be absurd to  supply the spinner with a distaff and spinning wheel. The cotton too must  not be such rubbish as to cause extra waste in being worked, but must be  of suitable quality.  Otherwise the spinner would be found to spend more  time in producing a pound of yarn than is socially necessary, in which  case the excess of time would create neither value nor money. But whether  the material factors of the process are of normal quality or not, depends  not upon the labourer, but entirely upon the capitalist. Then again, the  labour-power itself must be of average efficacy. In the trade in which  it is being employed, it must possess the average skill, handiness and  quickness prevalent in that trade, and our capitalist took good care to  buy labour-power of such normal goodness. This power must be applied with  the average amount of exertion and with the usual degree of intensity;  and the capitalist is as careful to see that this is done, as that his  workmen are not idle for a single moment. He has bought the use of the  labour-power for a definite period, and he insists upon his rights. He  has no intention of being robbed. Lastly, and for this purpose our friend  has a penal code of his own, all wasteful consumption of raw material or  instruments of labour is strictly forbidden, because what is so wasted,  represents labour superfluously expended, labour that does not  count in the product or enter into its value.

All labour of a higher or more complicated character than  average labour is expenditure of labour-power of a more costly kind, labour-power  whose production has cost more time and labour, and which therefore has  a higher value, than unskilled or simple labour-power. This  power being higher-value, its consumption is labour of a higher class,  labour that creates in equal times proportionally higher values than unskilled  labour does. Whatever difference in skill there may be between the labour  of a spinner and that of a jeweller, the portion of his labour by which  the jeweller merely replaces the value of his own labour-power, does not  in any way differ in quality from the additional portion by which he creates  surplus-value. In the making of jewellery, just as in spinning, the surplus-value  results only from a quantitative excess of labour, from a lengthening-out  of one and the same labour-process, in the one case, of the process of  making jewels, in the other of the process of making yarn.

The labourer  here is, to use a striking expression of the ancients, distinguishable  only as instrumentum vocale, from an animal as instrumentum semi-vocale,  and from an implement as instrumentum mutum. But he himself takes care  to let both beast and implement feel that he is none of them, but is a  man. He convinces himself with immense satisfaction, that he is a different  being, by treating the one unmercifully and damaging the other con amore.  Hence the principle, universally applied in this method of production,  only to employ the rudest and heaviest implements and such as are difficult  to damage owing to their sheer clumsiness. In the slave-states bordering  on the Gulf of Mexico, down to the date of the civil war, ploughs constructed  on old Chinese models, which turned up the soil like a hog or a mole, instead  of making furrows, were alone to be found. Conf. J. E. Cairnes. “The Slave  Power,” London, 1862, p. 46 sqq.

And I am assured that, in the careless and clumsy way they must  be used by the slaves, anything lighter or less rude could not be furnished  them with good economy, and that such tools as we constantly give our labourers  and find our profit in giving them, would not last out a day in a Virginia  cornfield – much lighter and more free from stones though it be than ours.  So, too, when I ask why mules are so universally substituted for horses  on the farm, the first reason given, and confessedly the most conclusive  one, is that horses cannot bear the treatment that they always must get  from negroes; horses are always soon foundered or crippled by them, while  mules will bear cudgelling, or lose a meal or two now and then, and not  be materially injured, and they do not take cold or get sick, if neglected  or overworked. But I do not need to go further than to the window of the  room in which I am writing, to see at almost any time, treatment of cattle  that would ensure the immediate discharge of the driver by almost any farmer  owning them in the North.” ","The

The distinction between skilled  and unskilled labour rests in part on pure illusion, or, to say the least,  on distinctions that have long since ceased to be real, and that survive  only by virtue of a traditional convention; in part on the helpless condition  of some groups of the working-class, a condition that prevents them from  exacting equally with the rest the value of their labour-power. Accidental  circumstances here play so great a part, that these two forms of labour  sometimes change places. Where, for instance, the physique of the working-class  has deteriorated, and is, relatively speaking, exhausted, which is the  case in all countries with a well developed capitalist production, the  lower forms of labour, which demand great expenditure of muscle, are in  general considered as skilled, compared with much more delicate forms of  labour; the latter sink down to the level of unskilled labour. Take as  an example the labour of a bricklayer, which in England occupies a much  higher level than that of a damask-weaver. Again, although the labour of  a fustian cutter demands great bodily exertion, and is at the same time  unhealthy, yet it counts only as unskilled labour. And then, we must not  forget, that the so-called skilled labour does not occupy a large space  in the field of national labour. Laing estimates that in England (and Wales)  the livelihood of 11,300,000 people depends on unskilled labour. If from  the total population of 18,000,000 living at the time when he wrote, we  deduct 1,000,000 for the “genteel population,” and 1,500,000 for paupers,  vagrants, criminals, prostitutes, &c., and 4,650,000 who compose the  middle-class, there remain the above mentioned 11,000,000. But in his middle-class  he includes people that live on the interest of small investments, officials,  men of letters, artists, schoolmasters and the like, and in order to swell  the number he also includes in these 4,650,000 the better paid portion  of the factory operatives! The bricklayers, too, figure amongst them. (S.  Laing: “National Distress,” &c., London, 1844). “The great class who  have nothing to give for food but ordinary labour, are the great bulk of  the people.” (James Mill, in art.: “Colony,” Supplement to the Encyclop.

This transfer  takes place during the conversion of those means into a product, or in  other words, during the labour-process. It is brought about by labour;  but how?  ","Constant

But, by the very  act of adding new value, he preserves their former values. Since, however,  the addition of new value to the subject of his labour, and the preservation  of its former value, are two entirely distinct results, produced simultaneously  by the labourer, during one operation, it is plain that this two-fold nature  of the result can be explained only by the two-fold nature of his labour;  at one and the same time, it must in one character create value, and in  another character preserve or transfer value.     ","Constant
Capital and Variable Capital"
776,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"Now, in what manner does every labourer add new labour and consequently  new value? Evidently, only by labouring productively in a particular  way; the spinner by spinning, the weaver by weaving, the smith by forging.  But, while thus incorporating labour generally, that is value, it is by  the particular form alone of the labour, by the spinning, the weaving and  the forging respectively, that the means of production, the cotton and  spindle, the yarn and loom, and the iron and anvil become constituent  elements of the product, of a new use-value.  Each  use-value disappears, but only to re-appear under a new form in a new use-value.  Now, we saw, when we were considering the process of creating value, that,  if a use-value be effectively consumed in the production of a new use-value,  the quantity of labour expended in the production of the consumed article,  forms a portion of the quantity of labour necessary to produce the new  use-value; this portion is therefore labour transferred from the means  of production to the new product. Hence, the labourer preserves the values  of the consumed means of production, or transfers them as portions of its  value to the product, not by virtue of his additional labour, abstractedly  considered, but by virtue of the particular useful character of that labour,  by virtue of its special productive form. In so far then as labour is such  specific productive activity, in so far as it is spinning, weaving, or  forging, it raises, by mere contact, the means of production from the  dead, makes them living factors of the labour-process, and combines with  them to form the new products.","Constant

777,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"If the special productive labour of the workman were not spinning,  he could not convert the cotton into yarn, and therefore could not transfer  the values of the cotton and spindle to the yarn. Suppose the same workman  were to change his occupation to that of a joiner, he would still by a  day’s labour add value to the material he works upon. Consequently, we  see, first, that the addition of new value takes place not by virtue of  his labour being spinning in particular, or joinering in particular, but  because it is labour in the abstract, a portion of the total labour of  society; and we see next, that the value added is of a given definite amount,  not because his labour has a special utility, but because it is exerted  for a definite time. On the one hand, then, it is by virtue of its general  character, as being expenditure of human labour-power in the abstract,  that spinning adds new value to the values of the cotton and the spindle;  and on the other hand, it is by virtue of its special character, as being  a concrete, useful process, that the same labour of spinning both transfers  the values of the means of production to the product, and preserves them  in the product. Hence at one and the same time there is produced a two-fold  result.  ","Constant

778,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"By the simple addition of a certain quantity of labour,  new value is added, and by the quality of this added labour, the original  values of the means of production are preserved in the product. This two-fold  effect, resulting from the two-fold character of labour, may be traced  in various phenomena.  ","Constant
Capital and Variable Capital"
779,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"Let us assume, that some invention enables the spinner to spin  as much cotton in 6 hours as he was able to spin before in 36 hours. His  labour is now six times as effective as it was, for the purposes of useful  production. The product of 6 hours’ work has increased six-fold, from 6  lbs. to 36 lbs. But now the 36 lbs. of cotton absorb only the same amount  of labour as formerly did the 6 lbs. One-sixth as much new labour is absorbed  by each pound of cotton, and consequently, the value added by the labour  to each pound is only one-sixth of what it formerly was. On the other hand,  in the product, in the 36 lbs. of yarn, the value transferred from the  cotton is six times as great as before. By the 6 hours’ spinning, the value  of the raw material preserved and transferred to the product is six times  as great as before, although the new value added by the labour of the spinner  to each pound of the very same raw material is one-sixth what it was formerly.  This shows that the two properties of labour, by virtue of which it is  enabled in one case to preserve value, and in the other to create value,  are essentially different. On the one hand, the longer the time necessary  to spin a given weight of cotton into yarn, the greater is the new value  added to the material; on the other hand, the greater the weight of the  cotton spun in a given time, the greater is the value preserved, by being  transferred from it to the product.  ","Constant
Capital and Variable Capital"
780,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"Let us now assume, that the productiveness of the spinner’s labour,  instead of varying, remains constant, that he therefore requires the same  time as he formerly did, to convert one pound of cotton into yarn, but  that the exchange-value of the cotton varies, either by rising to six times  its former value or falling to one-sixth of that value. In both these cases,  the spinner puts the same quantity of labour into a pound of cotton, and  therefore adds as much value, as he did before the change in the value:  he also produces a given weight of yarn in the same time as he did before.  Nevertheless, the value that he transfers from the cotton to the yarn is  either one-sixth of what it was before the variation, or, as the case may  be, six times as much as before. The same result occurs when the value  of the instruments of labour rises or falls, while their useful efficacy  in the process remains unaltered.  ","Constant
Capital and Variable Capital"
781,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"Again, if the technical conditions of the spinning process remain  unchanged, and no change of value takes place in the means of production,  the spinner continues to consume in equal working-times equal quantities  of raw material, and equal quantities of machinery of unvarying value.  The value that he preserves in the product is directly proportional  to the new value that he adds to the product. In two weeks he incorporates  twice as much labour, and therefore twice as much value, as in one week,  and during the same time he consumes twice as much material, and wears  out twice as much machinery, of double the value in each case: he therefore  preserves, in the product of two weeks, twice as much value as in the product  of one week. So long as the conditions of production remain the same, the  more value the labourer adds by fresh labour, the more value he transfers  and preserves; but he does so merely because this addition of new value  takes place under conditions that have not varied and are independent of  his own labour. Of course, it may be said in one sense, that the labourer  preserves old value always in proportion to the quantity of new value that  he adds. Whether the value of cotton rise from one shilling to two shillings,  or fall to sixpence, the workman invariably preserves in the product of  one hour only one half as much value as he preserves in two hours. In like  manner, if the productiveness of his own labour varies by rising or falling,  he will in one hour spin either more or less cotton, as the case may be,  than he did before, and will consequently preserve in the product of one  hour, more or less value of cotton; but, all the same, he will preserve  by two hours’ labour twice as much value as he will by one.

782,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm,"Value exists only in articles of utility, in objects: we leave  out of consideration its purely symbolical representation by tokens. (Man  himself, viewed as the impersonation of labour-power, is a natural object,  a thing, although a living conscious thing, and labour is the manifestation  of this power residing in him.) If therefore an article loses its utility,  it also loses its value. The reason why means of production do not lose  their value, at the same time that they lose their use-value, is this:  they lose in the labour-process the original form of their use-value, only  to assume in the product the form of a new use-value. But, however important  it may be to value, that it should have some object of utility to embody  itself in, yet it is a matter of complete indifference what particular  object serves this purpose; this we saw when treating of the metamorphosis  of commodities. Hence it follows that in the labour-process the means of  production transfer their value to the product only so far as along with  their use-value they lose also their exchange-value. They give up to the  product that value alone which they themselves lose as means of production.  But in this respect the material factors of the labour-process do not all  behave alike.  ","Constant

Dye stuffs  and other auxiliary substances also vanish but re-appear as properties  of the product. Raw material forms the substance of the product, but only  after it has changed its form. Hence raw material and auxiliary substances  lose the characteristic form with which they are clothed on entering the  labour-process. It is otherwise with the instruments of labour. Tools,  machines, workshops, and vessels, are of use in the labour-process, only  so long as they retain their original shape, and are ready each morning  to renew the process with their shape unchanged. And just as during their  lifetime, that is to say, during the continued labour-process in which  they serve, they retain their shape independent of the product, so, too,  they do after their death. The corpses of machines, tools, workshops, &c.,  are always separate and distinct from the product they helped to turn out.  If we now consider the case of any instrument of labour during the whole  period of its service, from the day of its entry into the workshop, till  the day of its banishment into the lumber room, we find that during this  period its use-value has been completely consumed, and therefore its exchange-value  completely transferred to the product. For instance, if a spinning machine  lasts for 10 years, it is plain that during that working period its total  value is gradually transferred to the product of the 10 years. The lifetime  of an instrument of labour, therefore, is spent in the repetition of a  greater or less number of similar operations. Its life may be compared  with that of a human being. Every day brings a man 24 hours nearer to his  grave: but how many days he has still to travel on that road, no man can  tell accurately by merely looking at him. This difficulty, however, does  not prevent life insurance offices from drawing, by means of the theory  of averages, very accurate, and at the same time very profitable conclusions.  So it is with the instruments of labour. It is known by experience how  long on the average a machine of a particular kind will last. Suppose its  use-value in the labour-process to last only six days. Then, on the average,  it loses each day one-sixth of its use-value, and therefore parts with  one-sixth of its value to the daily product. The wear and tear of all instruments,  their daily loss of use-value, and the corresponding quantity of value  they part with to the product, are accordingly calculated upon this basis.  ","Constant

If such an instrument has no  value to lose, if, in other words, it is not the product of human labour,  it transfers no value to the product.

Then  one thousandth part of the value of the machine is daily transferred to  the day’s product. At the same time, though with diminishing  vitality, the machine as a whole continues to take part in the labour-process.  Thus it appears, that one factor of the labour-process, a means of production,  continually enters as a whole into that process, while it enters into the  process of the formation of value by fractions only. The difference between  the two processes is here reflected in their material factors, by the same  instrument of production taking part as a whole in the labour-process,  while at the same time as an element in the formation of value, it enters  only by fractions.

Suppose that in spinning cotton, the waste for every 115 lbs.  used amounts to 15 lbs., which is converted, not into yarn, but into “devil’s  dust.” Now, although this 15 lbs. of cotton never becomes a constituent  element of the yarn, yet assuming this amount of waste to be normal and  inevitable under average conditions of spinning, its value is just as surely  transferred to the value of the yarn, as is the value of the 100 lbs. that  form the substance of the yarn. The use-value of 15 lbs. of cotton must  vanish into dust, before 100 lbs. of yarn can be made. The destruction  of this cotton is therefore a necessary condition in the production of  the yarn. And because it is a necessary condition, and for no other reason,  the value of that cotton is transferred to the product. The same holds  good for every kind of refuse resulting from a labour-process, so far at  least as such refuse cannot be further employed as a means in the production  of new and independent use-values. Such an employment of refuse  may be seen in the large machine works at Manchester, where mountains of  iron turnings are carted away to the foundry in the evening, in order the  next morning to re-appear in the workshops as solid masses of iron.

The maximum loss of value that they can  suffer in the process, is plainly limited by the amount of the original  value with which they came into the process, or in other words, by the  labour-time necessary for their production. Therefore, the means of production  can never add more value to the product than they themselves possess independently  of the process in which they assist. However useful a given kind of raw  material, or a machine, or other means of production may be, though it  may cost £150, or, say, 500 days’ labour, yet it cannot, under any  circumstances, add to the value of the product more than £150. Its  value is determined not by the labour-process into which it enters as a  means of production, but by that out of which it has issued as a product.  In the labour-process it only serves as a mere use-value, a thing with  useful properties, and could not, therefore, transfer any value to the  product, unless it possessed such value previously.

It deserts the consumed body, to occupy the newly created one. But this  transmigration takes place, as it were, behind the back of the labourer.  He is unable to add new labour, to create new value, without  at the same time preserving old values, and this, because the labour he  adds must be of a specific useful kind; and he cannot do work of a useful  kind, without employing products as the means of production of a new product,  and thereby transferring their value to the new product. The property therefore  which labour-power in action, living labour, possesses of preserving value,  at the same time that it adds it, is a gift of Nature which costs the labourer  nothing, but which is very advantageous to the capitalist inasmuch as it  preserves the existing value of his capital.

While the labourer, by virtue of his labour  being of a specialised kind that has a special object, preserves and transfers  to the product the value of the means of production, he at the same time,  by the mere act of working, creates each instant an additional or new value.  Suppose the process of production to be stopped just when the workman has  produced an equivalent for the value of his own labour-power, when, for  example, by six hours’ labour, he has added a value of three shillings.  This value is the surplus, of the total value of the product, over the  portion of its value that is due to the means of production. It is the  only original bit of value formed during this process, the only portion  of the value of the product created by this process. Of course, we do not  forget that this new value only replaces the money advanced by the capitalist  in the purchase of the labour-power, and spent by the labourer on the necessaries  of life. With regard to the money spent, the new value is merely a reproduction;  but, nevertheless, it is an actual, and not, as in the case of the value  of the means of production, only an apparent, reproduction.

The action of labour-power, therefore, not  only reproduces its own value, but produces value over and above it.

The means of  production on the one hand, labour-power on the other, are merely the different  modes of existence which the value of the original capital assumed when  from being money it was transformed into the various factors of the labour-process.  That part of capital then, which is represented by the means of production,  by the raw material, auxiliary material and the instruments of labour does  not, in the process of production, undergo any quantitative alteration  of value.

The same elements  of capital which, from the point of view of the labour-process, present  themselves respectively as the objective and subjective factors, as means  of production and labour-power, present themselves, from the point of view  of the process of creating surplus-value, as constant and variable capital.

Suppose the price  of cotton to be one day sixpence a pound, and the next day, in consequence  of a failure of the cotton crop, a shilling a pound. Each pound of the  cotton bought at sixpence, and worked up after the rise in value, transfers  to the product a value of one shilling; and the cotton already spun before  the rise, and perhaps circulating in the market as yarn, likewise transfers  to the product twice its original value. It is plain, however, that these  changes of value are independent of the increment or surplus-value added  to the value of the cotton by the spinning itself.  If the old cotton had  never been spun, it could, after the rise, be resold at a shilling a pound  instead of at sixpence. Further, the fewer the processes the cotton has  gone through, the more certain is this result. We therefore find that speculators  make it a rule when such sudden changes in value occur, to speculate in  that material on which the least possible quantity of labour has been spent:  to speculate, therefore, in yarn rather than in cloth, in cotton itself,  rather than in yarn. The change of value in the case we have been considering,  originates, not in the process in which the cotton plays the  part of a means of production, and in which it therefore functions as constant  capital, but in the process in which the cotton itself is produced. The  value of a commodity, it is true, is determined by the quantity of labour  contained in it, but this quantity is itself limited by social conditions.  If the time socially necessary for the production of any commodity alters  — and a given weight of cotton represents, after a bad harvest, more labour  than after a good one — all previously existing commodities of the same  class are affected, because they are, as it were, only individuals of the  species,  and their value at any given time is measured  by the labour socially necessary, i.e., by the labour necessary  for their production under the then existing social conditions.

The technical conditions of the labour-process  may be revolutionised to such an extent, that where formerly ten men using  ten implements of small value worked up a relatively small quantity of  raw material, one man may now, with the aid of one expensive machine, work  up one hundred times as much raw material. In the latter case we have an  enormous increase in the constant capital, that is represented by the total  value of the means of production used, and at the same time a great reduction  in the variable capital, invested in labour-power.

A machine that is undergoing repair,  no longer plays the part of an instrument, but that of a subject of labour.  Work is no longer done with it, but upon it. It is quite permissible for  our purpose to assume, that the labour expended on the repairs of instruments  is included in the labour necessary for their original production. But  in the text we deal with that wear and tear, which no doctor can cure,  and which little by little brings about death, with “that kind of wear  which cannot be repaired from time to time, and which, in the case of a  knife, would ultimately reduce it to a state in which the cutler would  say of it, it is not worth a new blade.” We have shewn in the text, that  a machine takes part in every labour-process as an integral machine, but  that into the simultaneous process of creating value it enters only bit  by bit. How great then is the confusion of ideas exhibited in the following  extract! “Mr. Ricardo says a portion of the labour of the engineer in making   machines” is contained for example in the value of a pair of  stockings. “Yet the total labour, that produced each single pair of stockings  ... includes the whole labour of the engineer, not a portion; for one machine  makes many pairs, and none of those pairs could have been done without  any part of the machine.” “Obs. on Certain Verbal Disputes in Pol. Econ.,  Particularly Relating to Value,” p. 54. The author, an uncommonly self-satisfied  wiseacre, is right in his confusion and therefore in his contention, to  this extent only, that neither Ricardo nor any other economist, before  or since him, has accurately distinguished the two aspects of labour, and  still less, therefore, the part played by it under each of these aspects  in the formation of value.","Constant

Say, who pretends to account for surplus-value (Interest, Profit,  Rent), by the “services productifs” which the means of production, soil,  instruments, and raw material, render in the labour-process by means of  their use-values. Mr. Wm. Roscher who seldom loses an occasion of registering,  in black and white, ingenious apologetic fancies, records the following  specimen: - “J. B. Say (Traité, t. 1, ch. 4) very truly remarks:  the value produced by an oil mill, after deduction of all costs, is something  new, something quite different from the labour by which the oil mill itself  was erected.” (l.c., p. 82, note.) Very true, Mr. Professor! the oil produced  by the oil mill is indeed something very different from the labour expended  in constructing the mill! By value, Mr. Roscher understands such stuff  as “oil,” because oil has value, notwithstanding that “Nature” produces  petroleum, though relatively “in small quantities,” a fact to which he  seems to refer in his further observation: “It (Nature) produces scarcely  any exchange-value.” Mr. Roscher’s “Nature” and the exchange-value it produces  are rather like the foolish virgin who admitted indeed that she had had  a child, but “it was such a little one.” This “savant sérieux” in  continuation remarks: “Ricardo’s school is in the habit of including capital  as accumulated labour under the head of labour. This is unskilful work,  because, indeed, the owner of capital, after all, does something more than  the merely creating and preserving of the same: namely, the abstention  from the enjoyment of it, for which he demands, e.g., interest.”   (l.c.)

813,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch09.htm,"The capital C is made up of two components, one, the sum of money  c laid out upon the means of production, and the other, the sum of money  v expended upon the labour-power; c represents the portion that has become  constant capital, and v the portion that has become variable capital. At  first then, C = c + v: for example, if £500 is the capital advanced,  its components may be such that the £500 = £410 const. + £90  var. When the process of production is finished, we get a commodity whose  value = (c + v) + s, where s is the surplus-value; or taking our  former figures, the value of this commodity may be (£410 const. +  £90 var.) + £90 surpl. The original capital has now changed  from C to C', from £500 to £590. The difference is s  or a surplus-value of £90. Since the value of the constituent elements  of the product is equal to the value of the advanced capital, it is mere  tautology to say, that the excess of the value of the product over the  value of its constituent elements, is equal to the expansion of the capital  advanced or to the surplus-value produced.     ","The

814,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch09.htm,"Nevertheless, we must examine this tautology a little more closely.  The two things compared are, the value of the product and the value of  its constituents consumed in the process of production. Now we have seen  how that portion of the constant capital which consists of the instruments  of labour, transfers to the production only a fraction of its value, while  the remainder of that value continues to reside in those instruments.  Since this remainder plays no part in the formation of value, we may at  present leave it on one side. To introduce it into the calculation would  make no difference. For instance, taking our former example, c = £410:  suppose this sum to consist of £312 value of raw material, £44  value of auxiliary material, and £54 value of the machinery worn  away in the process; and suppose that the total value of the machinery  employed is £1,054. Out of this latter sum, then, we reckon as advanced  for the purpose of turning out the product, the sum of £54 alone,  which the machinery loses by wear and tear in the process; for this is  all it parts with to the product. Now if we also reckon the remaining £1,000,  which still continues in the machinery, as transferred to the product,  we ought also to reckon it as part of the value advanced, and thus make  it appear on both sides of our calculation.  We should, in this way, get £1,500 on one side and £1,590 on the other.  The difference of these two sums, or the surplus-value, would still be  £90. Throughout this Book therefore, by constant capital advanced  for the production of value, we always mean, unless the context is repugnant  thereto, the value of the means of production actually consumed in the  process, and that value alone.

815,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch09.htm,"This being so, let us return to the formula C = c + v, which we  saw was transformed into C' = (c + v) + s, C becoming C'. We know that  the value of the constant capital is transferred to, and merely re-appears  in the product. The new value actually created in the process, the value  produced, or value-product, is therefore not the same as the value of the  product; it is not, as it would at first sight appear (c + v) + s or £410  const. + £90 var. + £90 surpl.; but v + s or £90 var.  + £90 surpl., not £590 but £180. If c = 0, or in other  words, if there were branches of industry in which the capitalist could  dispense with all means of production made by previous labour, whether  they be raw material, auxiliary material, or instruments of labour, employing  only labour-power and materials supplied by Nature, in that case, there  would be no constant capital to transfer to the product. This component  of the value of the product, i.e., the £410 in our example,  would be eliminated, but the sum of £180, the amount of new value  created, or the value produced, which contains £90 of surplus-value,  would remain just as great as if c represented the highest value imaginable.  We should have C = (0 + v) = v or C' the expanded capital = v + s and therefore C'  - C = s as before. On the other hand, if s = 0, or in other words, if the  labour-power, whose value is advanced in the form of variable capital,  were to produce only its equivalent, we should have C = c + v or C' the  value of the product = (c + v) + 0 or C = C'.

But the fact that it is v alone that varies,  and the conditions of that variation, are obscured by the circumstance  that in consequence of the increase in the variable component of the capital,  there is also an increase in the sum total of the advanced capital. It  was originally £500 and becomes £590. Therefore in order that  our investigation may lead to accurate results, we must make abstraction  from that portion of the value of the product, in which constant capital  alone appears, and consequently must equate the constant capital to zero  or make c = 0.

In our example, C' = £410 const. + £90 var. + £90  surpl.; but £90 is a given and therefore a constant quantity; hence  it appears absurd to treat it as variable. But in fact, the term £90  var. is here merely a symbol to show that this value undergoes a process.  The portion of the capital invested in the purchase of labour-power is  a definite quantity of materialised labour, a constant value like the value  of the labour-power purchased. But in the process of production the place  of the £90 is taken by the labour-power in action, dead labour is  replaced by living labour, something stagnant by something flowing, a constant  by a variable. The result is the reproduction of v plus an increment of  v. From the point of view then of capitalist production, the whole process  appears as the spontaneous variation of the originally constant value,  which is transformed into labour-power. Both the process and its result,  appear to be owing to this value. If, therefore, such expressions as “£90  variable capital,” or “so much self-expanding value,” appear contradictory,  this is only because they bring to the surface a contradiction immanent  in capitalist production.

If, for example,  we wish to calculate the amount of England’s profits from the cotton industry,  we first of all deduct the sums paid for cotton to the United States, India,  Egypt and other countries; in other words, the value of the capital that  merely re-appears in the value of the product, is put = 0.

We shall, therefore, in the third book, treat  of this ratio exhaustively. In order to enable one portion of a capital  to expand its value by being converted into labour-power, it is necessary  that another portion be converted into means of production. In order that  variable capital may perform its function, constant capital must be advanced  in proper proportion, a proportion given by the special technical conditions  of each labour-process. The circumstance, however, that retorts and other  vessels, are necessary to a chemical process, does not compel the chemist  to notice them in the result of his analysis. If we look at the means of  production, in their relation to the creation of value, and to the variation  in the quantity of value, apart from anything else, they appear simply  as the material in which labour-power, the value-creator, incorporates  itself. Neither the nature, nor the value of this material is of any importance.  The only requisite is that there be a sufficient supply to absorb the labour  expended in the process of production. That supply once given, the material  may rise or fall in value, or even be, as land and the sea, without any  value in itself; but this will have no influence on the creation of value  or on the variation in the quantity of value.

The capital advanced is consequently reduced from c + v to v, and instead  of the value of the product (c + v) + s we have now the value produced  (v + s). Given the new value produced = £180, which sum consequently  represents the whole labour expended during the process, then subtracting  from it £90 the value of the variable capital, we have remaining  £90, the amount of the surplus-value. This sum of £90 or s  expresses the absolute quantity of surplus-value produced. The relative  quantity produced, or the increase per cent of the variable capital, is  determined, it is plain, by the ratio of the surplus-value to the variable  capital, or is expressed by s/v. In our example this ratio is 90/90, which  gives an increase of 100%.

Now since his work forms part of a system,  based on the social division of labour, he does not directly produce the  actual necessaries which he himself consumes; he produces instead a particular  commodity, yarn for example, whose value is equal to the value of those  necessaries or of the money with which they can be bought.  The portion  of his day’s labour devoted to this purpose, will be greater or less, in  proportion to the value of the necessaries that he daily requires on an  average, or, what amounts to the same thing, in proportion to the labour-time  required on an average to produce them. If the value of those necessaries  represent on an average the expenditure of six hours’ labour, the workman  must on an average work for six hours to produce that value.  If instead  of working for the capitalist, he worked independently on his own account,  he would, other things being equal, still be obliged to labour for the  same number of hours, in order to produce the value of his labour-power,  and thereby to gain the means of subsistence necessary for his conservation  or continued reproduction. But as we have seen, during that portion of  his day’s labour in which he produces the value of his labour-power, say  three shillings, he produces only an equivalent for the value of his labour-power  already advanced  Necessary, as regards the labourer, because independent of the particular social form of his labour; necessary, as regards capital, and the world of capitalists, because on the continued existence  of the labourer depends their existence also.

He creates surplus-value which,  for the capitalist, has all the charms of a creation out of nothing. This  portion of the working-day, I name surplus labour-time, and to the labour  expended during that time, I give the name of surplus-labour. It is every  bit as important, for a correct understanding of surplus-value, to conceive  it as a mere congelation of surplus labour-time, as nothing but materialised  surplus-labour, as it is, for a proper comprehension of value, to conceive  it as a mere congelation of so many hours of labour, as nothing but materialised  labour. The essential difference between the various economic forms of  society, between, for instance, a society based on slave-labour, and one  based on wage-labour, lies only in the mode in which this surplus-labour  is in each case extracted from the actual producer, the labourer.

But in truth, the rate of surplus-value is not equal  to s/C or s/(c+v), but to s/v: thus it is not 90/500 but 90/90 or 100%, which is more  than five times the apparent degree of exploitation. Although, in the case  we have supposed, we are ignorant of the actual length of the working-day,  and of the duration in days or weeks of the labour-process, as also of  the number of labourers employed, yet the rate of surplus-value s/v accurately  discloses to us, by means of its equivalent expression, surplus-labour/necessary  labour the relation between the two parts of the working-day.

We assume the waste to be 6%: under these  circumstances 10,600 lbs. of cotton are consumed weekly, of which 600 lbs.  go to waste. The price of the cotton in April, 1871, was 7¾d. per lb.;  the raw material therefore costs in round numbers £342. The  10,000 spindles, including preparation-machinery, and motive power, cost,  we will assume, £1 per spindle, amounting to a total of £10,000.  The wear and tear we put at 10%, or £1,000 yearly = £20 weekly.  The rent of the building we suppose to be £300 a year, or £6  a week.  Coal consumed (for 100 horse-power indicated, at 4 lbs. of coal  per horse-power per hour during 60 hours, and inclusive of that consumed  in heating the mill), 11 tons a week at 8s. 6d. a ton, amounts to about  £4½ a week: gas, £1 a week, oil, &c., £4½ a  week. Total cost of the above auxiliary materials, £10 weekly. Therefore  the constant portion of the value of the week’s product is £378.  Wages amount to £52 a week. The price of the yarn is 12¼d. per.  lb. which gives for the value of 10,000 lbs. the sum of £510. The  surplus-value is therefore in this case £510 - £430 = £80.  We put the constant part of the value of the product = 0, as it plays no  part in the creation of value. There remains £132 as the weekly value  created, which = £52 var. + £80 surpl. The rate of surplus-value  is therefore 80/52 = 153 11/13%. In a working-day of 10 hours with average  labour the result is: necessary labour = 3 31/33 hours, and surplus-labour  = 6 2/33.  ","The

With their usual practical acuteness, they  had found out that the learned Professor “wanted a good deal of finishing;”   it was this discovery that caused them to write for him. On his side the  Professor has embodied the lecture he received from the Manchester manufacturers,  in a pamphlet, entitled: “Letters on the Factory Act, as it affects the  cotton manufacture.” London, 1837.

I will suppose  a manufacturer to invest £100,000: — £80,000 in his mill and  machinery, and £20,000 in raw material and wages. The annual return  of that mill, supposing the capital to be turned once a year,  and gross profits to be 15 per cent., ought to be goods worth £115,000....  Of this £115,000, each of the twenty-three half-hours of work produces  5-115ths or one twenty-third. Of these 23-23rds (constituting the whole  £115,000) twenty, that is to say £100,000 out of the  £115,000, simply replace the capital; — one twenty-third (or £5,000  out of the £115,000) makes up for the deterioration of the mill and  machinery. The remaining 2-23rds, that is, the last two of the twenty-three  half-hours of every day, produce the net profit of 10 per cent. If, therefore  (prices remaining the same), the factory could be kept at work thirteen  hours instead of eleven and a half, with an addition of about £2,600  to the circulating capital, the net profit would be more than doubled.  On the other hand, if the hours of working were reduced by one hour per  day (prices remaining the same), the net profit would be destroyed  — if they were reduced by one hour and a half, even the gross profit  would be destroyed.”","The

His answer would simply have been: — Gentlemen!  if you work your mills for 10 hours instead of 11½, then,  other things being equal, the daily consumption of cotton, machinery, &c.,  will decrease in proportion. You gain just as much as you lose. Your work-people  will in future spend one hour and a half less time in reproducing or replacing  the capital that has been advanced. — If, on the other hand, he did not  believe them without further inquiry, but, as being an expert in such matters,  deemed an analysis necessary, then he ought, in a question that is concerned  exclusively with the relations of net profit to the length of the working-day,  before all things to have asked the manufacturers, to be careful not to  lump together machinery, workshops, raw material, and labour, but to be  good enough to place the constant capital, invested in buildings, machinery,  raw material, &c., on one side of the account, and the capital advanced  in wages on the other side.

Now, since in equal periods he produces equal values, the produce of the  last hour but one, must have the same value as that of the last hour. Further,  it is only while he labours that he produces any value at all, and the  amount of his labour is measured by his labour-time. This you say, amounts  to 11½ hours a day. He employs one portion of these 11½ hours, in  producing or replacing his wages, and the remaining portion in producing  your net profit. Beyond this he does absolutely nothing. But since, on  your assumption, his wages, and the surplus-value he yields, are of equal  value, it is clear that he produces his wages in 5¾ hours, and your  net profit in the other 5¾ hours. Again, since the value of the yarn  produced in 2 hours, is equal to the sum of the values of his wages and  of your net profit, the measure of the value of this yarn must be 11½  working-hours, of which 5¾ hours measure the value of the yarn produced  in the last hour but one, and 5¾, the value of the yarn produced in  the last hour. We now come to a ticklish point; therefore, attention! The  last working-hour but one is, like the first, an ordinary working-hour,  neither more nor less. How then can the spinner produce in one hour, in  the shape of yarn, a value that embodies 5¾ hours’ labour? The truth  is that he performs no such miracle. The use-value produced by him in one  hour, is a definite quantity of yarn. The value of this yarn is measured  by 5¾ working-hours, of which 4¾ were, without any assistance  from him, previously embodied in the means of production, in the cotton,  the machinery, and so on; the remaining one hour alone is added by him.  Therefore since his wages are produced in 5¾ hours, and the yarn produced  in one hour also contains 5¾ hours’ work, there is no witchcraft in  the result, that the value created by his 5¾ hours’ spinning, is equal  to the value of the product spun in one hour. You are altogether on the  wrong track, if you think that he loses a single moment of his working-day,  in reproducing or replacing the values of the cotton, the machinery, and  so on. On the contrary, it is because his labour converts the cotton and  spindles into yarn, because he spins, that the values of the cotton and  spindles go over to the yarn of their own accord. This result is owing  to the quality of his labour, not to its quantity. It is true, he will  in one hour transfer to the yarn more value, in the shape of cotton, than  he will in half an hour; but that is only because in one hour he spins  up more cotton than in half an hour. You see then, your assertion, that  the workman produces, in the last hour but one, the value of his wages,  and in the last hour your net profit, amounts to no more than this, that  in the yarn produced by him in 2 working-hours, whether they are the 2  first or the 2 last hours of the working-day, in that yarn, there are incorporated  11½ working-hours, or just a whole day’s work, i.e., two hours  of his own work and 9½ hours of other people’s. And my assertion that,  in the first 5¾ hours, he produces his wages, and in the last 5¾  hours your net profit, amounts only to this, that you pay him for the former,  but not for the latter. In speaking of payment of labour, instead of payment  of labour-power, I only talk your own slang. Now, gentlemen, if you compare  the working-time you pay for, with that which you do not pay for, you will  find that they are to one another, as half a day is to half a day; this  gives a rate of 100%, and a very pretty percentage it is. Further, there  is not the least doubt, that if you make your “hands” toil for 13 hours,  instead of 11½, and, as may be expected from you, treat the work done  in that extra one hour and a half, as pure surplus-labour, then the latter  will be increased from 5¾ hours’ labour to 7¼ hours’ labour, and  the rate of surplus-value from 100% to 126 2/23%. So that you are altogether  too sanguine, in expecting that by such an addition of 1½ hours to the  working-day, the rate will rise from 100% to 200% and more, in other words  that it will be “more than doubled.” On the other hand — man’s heart is a  wonderful thing, especially when carried in the purse — you take too pessimist  a view, when you fear, that with a reduction of the hours of labour from  11½ to 10, the whole of your net profit will go to the dogs. Not at  all. All other conditions remaining the same, the surplus-labour will fall  from 5¾ hours to 4¾ hours, a period that still gives a very profitable  rate of surplus-value, namely 82 14/23%. But this dreadful “last hour,”   about which you have invented more stories than have the millenarians about  the day of judgment, is “all bosh.” If it goes, it will cost neither you,  your net profit, nor the boys and girls whom you employ, their “purity  of mind.”  Whenever your “last hour” strikes in earnest, think  of the Oxford Professor.

So, too,  we pass over any question as to the accuracy of his figures. Leonard Horner  has shown in “A Letter to Mr. Senior,” &c., London, 1837, that they  are worth no more than so-called “Analysis.” Leonard Horner was one of  the Factory Inquiry Commissioners in 1833, and Inspector, or rather Censor  of Factories till 1859. He rendered undying service to the English working-class.  He carried on a life-long contest, not only with the embittered manufacturers,  but also with the Cabinet, to whom the number of votes given by the masters  in the Lower House, was a matter of far greater importance than the number  of hours worked by the “hands” in the mills.","The

871,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch09.htm,"  Apart from efforts in principle, Senior’s statement is confused.  What he really intended to say was this: The manufacturer employs the workman  for 11½ hours or for 23 half-hours daily. As the working-day, so, too,  the working year, may be conceived to consist of 11½ hours or 23 half-hours,  but each multiplied by the number of working-days in the year. On this  supposition, the 23 half-hours yield an annual product of £115,000;  one half-hour yields 1/23 × £115,000; 20 half-hours yield 20/23 ×  £115,000 = £100,000, i.e., they replace no more than  the capital advanced. There remain 3 half-hours, which yield 3/23 × £115,000  = £5,000 or the gross profit. Of these 3 half-hours, one yields 1/23  × £115,000 = £15,000; i.e., it makes up for the wear  and tear of the machinery; the remaining 2 half-hours, i.e., the  last hour, yield 2/23 × £115,000 = £10,000 or the net profit.  In the text Senior converts the last 2/23 of the product into portions  of the working-day itself.","The

If, on the one hand, Senior proved  that the net profit of the manufacturer, the existence of the English cotton  industry, and England’s command of the markets of the world, depend on   “the last working-hour,” on the other hand, Dr. Andrew Ure showed, that  if children and young persons under 18 years of age, instead of being kept  the full 12 hours in the warm and pure moral atmosphere of the factory,  are turned out an hour sooner into the heartless and frivolous outer world,  they will be deprived, by idleness and vice, of all hope of salvation for  their souls. Since 1848, the factory inspectors have never tired of twitting  the masters with this “last,” this “fatal hour.” Thus Mr. Hovell in his  report of the 21st May, 1855: “Had the following ingenious calculation  (he quotes Senior) been correct, every cotton factory in the United Kingdom  would have been working at a loss since the year 1850.” (Reports of the  Insp. of Fact., for the half-year, ending 30th April, 1855, pp. 19, 20.)  In the year 1848, after the passing of the 10 hours’ bill, the masters  of some flax spinning mills, scattered, few and far between, over the country  on the borders of Dorset and Somerset, foisted a petition against the bill  on to the shoulders of a few of their work-people. One of the clauses of  this petition is as follows: “Your petitioners, as parents, conceive that  an additional hour of leisure will tend more to demoralise the children  than otherwise, believing that idleness is the parent of vice.” On this  the factory report of 31st Oct., 1848, says: The atmosphere of the flax  mills, in which the children of these virtuous and tender parents work,  is so loaded with dust and fibre from the raw material, that it is exceptionally  unpleasant to stand even 10 minutes in the spinning rooms: for you are  unable to do so without the most painful sensation, owing to the eyes,  the ears, the nostrils, and mouth, being immediately filled by the clouds  of flax dust from which there is no escape. The labour itself, owing to  the feverish haste of the machinery, demands unceasing application of skill  and movement, under the control of a watchfulness that never tires, and  it seems somewhat hard, to let parents apply the term “idling” to their  own children, who, after allowing for meal-times, are fettered for 10 whole  hours to such an occupation, in such an atmosphere.... These children work  longer than the labourers in the neighbouring villages.... Such cruel talk  about “idleness and vice” ought to be branded as the purest cant, and the  most shameless hypocrisy.... That portion of the public, who, about 12  years ago, were struck by the assurance with which, under the sanction  of high authority, it was publicly and most earnestly proclaimed, that  the whole net profit of the manufacturer flows from the labour of the last  hour, and that, therefore, the reduction of the working-day by one hour,  would destroy his net profit, that portion of the public, we say, will  hardly believe its own eyes, when it now finds, that the original discovery  of the virtues of “the last hour” has since been so far improved, as to  include morals as well as profit; so that, if the duration of the labour  of children, is reduced to a full 10 hours, their morals, together with  the net profits of their employers, will vanish, both being dependent on  this last, this fatal hour. (See Repts., Insp. of Fact., for 31st Oct.,  1848, p. 101.) The same report then gives some examples of the morality  and virtue of these same pure-minded manufacturers, of the tricks, the  artifices, the cajoling, the threats, and the falsifications, they made  use of, in order, first, to compel a few defenceless workmen to sign petitions  of such a kind, and then to impose them upon Parliament as the petitions  of a whole branch of industry, or a whole country. It is highly characteristic  of the present status of so-called economic science, that neither Senior  himself, who, at a later period, to his honour be it said, energetically  supported the factory legislation, nor his opponents, from first to last,  have ever been able to explain the false conclusions of the “original discovery.”   They appeal to actual experience, but the why and wherefore remains a mystery.","The

In the “Letters  on the Factory Act,” he makes the whole net gains including “profit” and   “interests” and even “something more,” depend upon a single unpaid hour’s  work of the labourer. One year previously, in his “Outlines of Political  Economy,” written for the instruction of Oxford students and cultivated  Philistines, he had also “discovered, in opposition to Ricardo’s determination  of value by labour, that profit is derived from the labour of the capitalist,  and interest from his asceticism, in other words, from his abstinence.”   The dodge was an old one, but the word “abstinence” was new. Herr Roscher  translates it rightly by “Enthaltung.” Some of his countrymen, the Browns,  Jones, and Robinsons, of Germany, not so well versed in Latin as he, have,  monk-like, rendered it by “Entsagung” (renunciation).","The

Is not the real interest of the nation similar? Provided its net real income,  its rent and profits, be the same, it is of no importance whether the nation  consists of 10 or of 12 millions of inhabitants.” (Ric. l.c.,.p. 416.)  Long before Ricardo, Arthur Young, a fanatical upholder of surplus-produce,  for the rest, a rambling, uncritical writer, whose reputation is in the  inverse ratio of his merit, says, “Of what use, in a modern kingdom, would  be a whole province thus divided , however well cultivated, except for the mere purpose of breeding  men, which taken singly is a most useless purpose?” (Arthur Young: “Political  Arithmetic, &c.” London, 1774, p. 47.)","The

885,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"We started with the supposition that labour-power  is bought and sold at its value. Its value, like that of all other commodities,  is determined by the working-time necessary to its production. If the production  of the average daily means of subsistence of the labourer takes up 6 hours,  he must work, on the average, 6 hours every day, to produce his daily labour-power,  or to reproduce the value received as the result of its sale. The necessary  part of his working-day amounts to 6 hours, and is, therefore, caeteris  paribus , a given quantity. But with this, the extent of the working-day itself is not yet given.","The
Working-Day"
886,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"Let us assume that the line A–––B represents the length of the necessary working-time, say 6 hours. If the labour be prolonged 1, 3, or 6 hours beyond A—–B, we have 3 other lines:","The
Working-Day"
887,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"representing 3 different working-days of 7, 9, and 12 hours. The extension  B—–C of the line A—–B represents the length of the surplus-labour. As  the working-day is A—–B + B—–C or A—–C, it varies with the variable  quantity B—–C. Since A—–B is constant, the ratio of B—–C to A—–B can  always be calculated. In working-day I, it is 1/6, in working-day II, 3/6,  in working day III 6/6 of A—–B. Since further the ratio (surplus working-time)/(necessary working-time), determines the rate of the surplus-value, the latter is given by the ratio  of B—-C to A—-B. It amounts in the 3 different working-days respectively  to 16 2/3, 50 and 100 per cent. On the other hand, the rate of surplus-value  alone would not give us the extent of the working-day. If this rate, e.g.,  were  100 per cent., the working-day might be of 8, 10, 12, or more hours. It  would indicate that the 2 constituent parts of the working-day, necessary-labour  and surplus-labour time, were equal in extent, but not how long each of  these two constituent parts was.    ","The
Working-Day"
888,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"The working-day is thus not a constant, but a variable quantity.  One of its parts, certainly, is determined by the working-time required  for the reproduction of the labour-power of the labourer himself. But its  total amount varies with the duration of the surplus-labour. The working-day  is, therefore, determinable, but is, per se, indeterminate.  ","The
Working-Day"
889,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"Although the working-day is not a fixed, but a fluent quantity,  it can, on the other hand, only vary within certain limits. The minimum  limit is, however, not determinable; of course, if we make the extension  line B—‑C or the surplus-labour = 0, we have a minimum limit, i.e.,  the part of the day which the labourer must necessarily work for his own  maintenance. On the basis of capitalist production, however, this necessary  labour can form a part only of the working-day; the working-day itself  can never be reduced to this minimum. On the other hand, the working-day  has a maximum limit. It cannot be prolonged beyond a certain point. This  maximum limit is conditioned by two things. First, by the physical bounds  of labour-power. Within the 24 hours of the natural day a man can expend  only a definite quantity of his vital force. A horse, in like manner, can  only work from day to day, 8 hours. During part of the day this force must  rest, sleep; during another part the man has to satisfy other physical  needs, to feed, wash, and clothe himself. Besides these purely physical  limitations, the extension of the working-day encounters moral ones. The  labourer needs time for satisfying his intellectual and social wants, the  extent and number of which are conditioned by the general state of social  advancement. The variation of the working-day fluctuates, therefore, within  physical and social bounds. But both these limiting conditions are of a  very elastic nature, and allow the greatest latitude. So we find working-days  of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 hours, i.e., of the most different lengths.    ","The

That is why you bought it. That which on your side appears a spontaneous  expansion of capital, is on mine extra expenditure of labour-power. You  and I know on the market only one law, that of the exchange of commodities.  And the consumption of the commodity belongs not to the seller who parts  with it, but to the buyer, who acquires it. To you, therefore, belongs  the use of my daily labour-power. But by means of the price that you pay  for it each day, I must be able to reproduce it daily, and to sell it again.  Apart from natural exhaustion through age, &c., I must be able on the  morrow to work with the same normal amount of force, health and freshness  as to-day. You preach to me constantly the gospel of “saving” and “abstinence.”  Good! I will, like a sensible saving owner, husband my sole wealth, labour-power,  and abstain from all foolish waste of it. I will each day spend, set in  motion, put into action only as much of it as is compatible with its  normal duration, and healthy development. By an unlimited extension of  the working-day, you may in one day use up a quantity of labour-power greater  than I can restore in three. What you gain in labour I lose in substance.  The use of my labour-power and the spoliation of it are quite different  things. If the average time that (doing a reasonable amount of work) an  average labourer can live, is 30 years, the value of my labour-power, which  you pay me from day to day is 1/(365×30) or 1/10950 of its total value.  But if you consume it in 10 years, you pay me daily 1/10950 instead of  1/3650 of its total value, i.e., only 1/3 of its daily value,  and you rob me, therefore, every day of 2/3 of the value of my commodity.  You pay me for one day’s labour-power, whilst you use that of 3 days. That  is against our contract and the law of exchanges. I demand, therefore,  a working-day of normal length, and I demand it without any appeal to your  heart, for in money matters sentiment is out of place. You may be a model  citizen, perhaps a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty  to Animals, and in the odour of sanctity to boot; but the thing that you  represent face to face with me has no heart in its breast. That which seems  to throb there is my own heart-beating. I demand the normal working-day  because I, like every other seller, demand the value of my commodity.  ","The

On the other hand, the  peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption  by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he  wishes to reduce the working-day to one of definite normal duration. There  is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing  the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides. Hence  is it that in the history of capitalist production, the determination of  what is a working-day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle  between collective capital, i.e., the class of capitalists, and  collective labour, i.e., the working-class.  ","The

900,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"Capital has not invented surplus-labour. Wherever  a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production, the  labourer, free or not free, must add to the working-time necessary for  his own maintenance an extra working-time in order to produce the means  of subsistence for the owners of the means of production,  Still these are exceptions in antiquity. But as soon as people, whose  production still moves within the lower forms of slave-labour, corvée-labour,  &c., are drawn into the whirlpool of an international market dominated  by the capitalistic mode of production, the sale of their products for  export becoming their principal interest, the civilised horrors of over-work  are grafted on the barbaric horrors of slavery, serfdom, &c. Hence  the negro labour in the Southern States of the American Union preserved  something of a patriarchal character, so long as production was chiefly  directed to immediate local consumption. But in proportion, as the export  of cotton became of vital interest to these states, the over-working of  the negro and sometimes the using up of his life in 7 years of labour became  a factor in a calculated and calculating system. It was no longer a question  of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products. It was now  a question of production of surplus-labour itself: So was it  also with the corvée, e.g., in the Danubian Principalities (now  Roumania).  ","The

Working-Day"
902,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"Suppose the working-day consists of 6 hours of necessary labour,  and 6 hours of surplus-labour. Then the free labourer gives the capitalist  every week 6 x 6 or 36 hours of surplus-labour. It is the same as if he  worked 3 days in the week for himself, and 3 days in the week gratis for  the capitalist. But this is not evident on the surface. Surplus-labour  and necessary labour glide one into the other. I can, therefore, express  the same relationship by saying, e.g., that the labourer in every minute  works 30 seconds for himself, and 30 for the capitalist, etc. It is otherwise  with the corvée. The necessary labour which the Wallachian peasant  does for his own maintenance is distinctly marked off from his surplus-labour  on behalf of the Boyard. The one he does on his own field, the other on  the seignorial estate. Both parts of the labour-time exist, therefore,  independently, side by side one with the other. In the corvée the  surplus-labour is accurately marked off from the necessary labour. This,  however, can make no difference with regard to the quantitative relation  of surplus-labour to necessary labour. Three days’ surplus-labour in the  week remain three days that yield no equivalent to the labourer himself,  whether it be called corvée or wage-labour. But in the capitalist  the greed for surplus-labour appears in the straining after an unlimited  extension of the working-day, in the Boyard more simply in a direct hunting  after days of corvée.  ","The
Working-Day"
903,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"In the Danubian Principalities the corvée was mixed up  with rents in kind and other appurtenances of bondage, but it formed the  most important tribute paid to the ruling class. Where this was the case,  the corvée rarely arose from serfdom; serfdom much more frequently  on the other hand took origin from the corvée.  This is what took place in the Roumanian provinces. Their original  mode of production was based on community of the soil, but not in the Slavonic  or Indian form. Part of the land was cultivated in severalty as freehold  by the members of the community, another part — ager publicus —  was cultivated by them in common. The products of this common labour served  partly as a reserve fund against bad harvests and other accidents, partly  as a public store for providing the costs of war, religion, and other common  expenses. In course of time military and clerical dignitaries usurped,  along with the common land, the labour spent upon it. The labour of the  free peasants on their common land was transformed into corvée for  the thieves of the common land. This corvée soon developed into  a servile relationship existing in point of fact, not in point of law,  until Russia, the liberator of the world, made it legal under presence  of abolishing serfdom. The code of the corvée, which the Russian  General Kisseleff proclaimed in 1831, was of course dictated by the Boyards  themselves. Thus Russia conquered with one blow the magnates of the Danubian  provinces, and the applause of liberal cretins throughout Europe.  ","The
Working-Day"
904,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm,"According to the “Règlement organique,” as this code of  the corvée is called, every Wallachian peasant owes to the so-called  landlord, besides a mass of detailed payments in kind: (1), 12 days  of general labour; (2), one day of field labour; (3), one  day of wood carrying. In all, 14 days in the year. With deep insight into  Political Economy, however, the working-day is not taken in its ordinary  sense, but as the working-day necessary to the production of an average  daily product; and that average daily product is determined in so crafty  a way that no Cyclops would be done with it in 24 hours. In dry words,  the Réglement itself declares with true Russian irony that by 12  working-days one must understand the product of the manual labour of 36  days, by 1 day of field labour 3 days, and by 1 day of wood carrying in  like manner three times as much. In all, 42 corvée days. To this  had to be added the so-called jobagie, service due to the lord for extraordinary  occasions. In proportion to the size of its population, every village has  to furnish annually a definite contingent to the jobagie. This additional  corvée is estimated at 14 days for each Wallachian peasant. Thus  the prescribed corvée amounts to 56 working-days yearly. But the  agricultural year in Wallachia numbers in consequence of the severe climate  only 210 days, of which 40 for Sundays and holidays, 30 on an average for  bad weather, together 70 days, do not count. 140 working-days remain. The  ratio of the corvée to the necessary labour 56/84 or 66 2/3 % gives  a much smaller rate of surplus-value than that which regulates the labour  of the English agricultural or factory labourer. This is, however, only  the legally prescribed corvée. And in a spirit yet more “liberal”   than the English Factory Acts, the “Règlement organique”   has known how to facilitate its own evasion. After it has made 56 days  out of 12, the nominal day’s work of each of the 56 corvée days  is again so arranged that a portion of it must fall on the ensuing day.  In one day, e.g., must be weeded an extent of land, which, for this work,  especially in maize plantations, needs twice as much time. The legal day’s  work for some kinds of agricultural labour is interpretable in such a way  that the day begins in May and ends in October. In Moldavia conditions  are still harder.","The

Apart from the  working-class movement that daily grew more threatening, the limiting of  factory labour was dictated by the same necessity which spread guano over  the English fields.

His report,  together with the evidence given, roused not the heart of the public but its stomach.

He then lies down  upon the kneading-board, which is also the covering of the trough in which  the dough is ‘made’; and with a sack under him, and another rolled up as  a pillow, he sleeps for about a couple of hours. He is then engaged in  a rapid and continuous labour for about five hours — throwing out the  dough, ‘scaling it off,’ moulding it, putting it into the oven, preparing  and baking rolls and fancy bread, taking the batch bread out of the oven,  and up into the shop, &c., &c.

While they fail to do this, their mere existence causes a relative loss  to the capitalist, for they represent during the time they lie fallow,  a useless advance of capital. And this loss becomes positive and absolute  as soon as the intermission of their employment necessitates additional  outlay at the recommencement of work. The prolongation of the working-day  beyond the limits of the natural day, into the night, only acts as a palliative.  It quenches only in a slight degree the vampire thirst for the living blood  of labour. To appropriate labour during all the 24 hours of the day is,  therefore, the inherent tendency of capitalist production. But as it is  physically impossible to exploit the same individual labour-power constantly  during the night as well as the day, to overcome this physical hindrance,  an alternation becomes necessary between the workpeople whose powers are  exhausted by day, and those who are used up by night. This alternation  may be effected in various ways; e.g., it may be so arranged that part  of the workers are one week employed on day-work, the next week on night-work.

How far may the working-day be extended beyond the working-time necessary  for the reproduction of labour-power itself?” It has been seen that to  these questions capital replies: the working-day contains the full 24 hours,  with the deduction of the few hours of repose without which labour-power  absolutely refuses its services again. Hence it is self-evident that the  labourer is nothing else, his whole life through, than labour-power, that  therefore all his disposable time is by nature and law labour-time, to  be devoted to the self-expansion of capital. Time for education, for intellectual  development, for the fulfilling of social functions and for social intercourse,  for the free-play of his bodily and mental activity, even the rest time  of Sunday (and that in a country of Sabbatarians!)   — moonshine! But in its blind unrestrainable passion, its were-wolf hunger  for surplus-labour, capital oversteps not only the moral, but even the  merely physical maximum bounds of the working-day. It usurps the time for  growth, development, and healthy maintenance of the body. It steals the  time required for the consumption of fresh air and sunlight. It higgles  over a meal-time, incorporating it where possible with the process of production  itself, so that food is given to the labourer as to a mere means of production,  as coal is supplied to the boiler, grease and oil to the machinery. It  reduces the sound sleep needed for the restoration, reparation, refreshment  of the bodily powers to just so many hours of torpor as the revival of  an organism, absolutely exhausted, renders essential. It is not the normal  maintenance of the labour-power which is to determine the limits of the  working-day; it is the greatest possible daily expenditure of labour-power,  no matter how diseased, compulsory, and painful it may be, which is to  determine the limits of the labourers’ period of repose. Capital cares  nothing for the length of life of labour-power. All that concerns it is  simply and solely the maximum of labour-power, that can be rendered fluent  in a working-day. It attains this end by shortening the extent of the labourer’s  life, as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from the soil by robbing  it of its fertility.    ","The

The mass of the surplus-value  produced is therefore equal to the surplus-value which the working day of  one labourer supplies multiplied by the number of labourers employed. But  as further the mass of surplus-value which a single labourer produces, the  value of labour-power being given, is determined by the rate of the surplus-value,  this law follows: the mass of the surplus-value produced is equal  to the amount of the variable capital advanced, multiplied by the rate  of surplus-value, in other words: it is determined by the compound ratio  between the number of labour-powers exploited simultaneously by the same  capitalist and the degree of exploitation of each individual labour-power.

If the variable capital diminishes, and at the same time the rate of surplus-value  increases in the same ratio, the mass of surplus-value produced remains  unaltered. If on our earlier assumption the capitalist must advance 300s.,  in order to exploit 100 labourers a day, and if the rate of surplus-value  amounts to 50%, this variable capital of 300s. yields a surplus-value of  150s. or of 100 × 3 workinghours. If the rate of surplus-value doubles,  or the working day, instead of being extended from 6 to 9, is extended from  6 to 12 hours and at the same time variable capital is lessened by half,  and reduced to 150s., it yields also a surplus-value of 150s. or 50 × 6  workinghours. Diminution of the variable capital may therefore be compensated  by a proportionate rise in the degree of exploitation of labour-power,  or the decrease in the number of the labourers employed by a proportionate  extension of the working day. Within certain limits therefore the supply  of labour exploitable by capital is independent of the supply of labourers.   On the contrary, a fall in the rate of surplus-value leaves unaltered the mass of the surplus-value produced, if the amount  of the variable capital, or number of the labourers employed, increases  in the same proportion.  ","Rate

Whatever the value of labour-power may be, whether  the workingtime necessary for the maintenance of the labourer is 2 or 10  hours, the total value that a labourer can produce, day in, day out, is  always less than the value in which 24 hours of labour are embodied, less  than 12s., if 12s. is the money expression for 24 hours of realised labour.  In our former assumption, according to which 6 workinghours are daily necessary  in order to reproduce the labour-power itself or to replace the value of  the capital advanced in its purchase, a variable capital of 1,500s., that  employs 500 labourers at a rate of surplus-value of 100% with a 12 hours’  working day, produces daily a surplus-value of 1,500s. or of 6 × 500 workinghours.  A capital of 300s. that employs 100 labourers a day with a rate of surplus-value  of 200% or with a working day of 18 hours, produces only a mass of surplus-value  of 600s. or 12 × 100 workinghours; and its total value-product, the equivalent  of the variable capital advanced plus the surplus-value, can, day in, day  out, never reach the sum of 1,200s. or 24 × 100 workinghours. The absolute  limit of the average working day — this being by nature always less than  24 hours — sets an absolute limit to the compensation of a reduction of  variable capital by a higher rate of surplus-value, or of the decrease of  the number of labourers exploited by a higher degree of exploitation of  labour-power. This palpable law is of importance for the clearing up of  many phenomena, arising from a tendency (to be worked out later on) of  capital to reduce as much as possible the number of labourers employed  by it, or its variable constituent transformed into labour-power, in contradiction  to its other tendency to produce the greatest possible mass of surplus-value.  On the other hand, if the mass of labour-power employed, or the amount  of variable capital, increases, but not in proportion to the fall in the  rate of surplus-value, the mass of the surplus-value produced, falls.  ","Rate
and Mass of Surplus-Value"
1288,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch11.htm,"A third law results from the determination, of the mass of the  surplus-value produced, by the two factors: rate of surplus-value and amount  of variable capital advanced. The rate of surplus-value, or the degree of  exploitation of labour-power, and the value of labour-power, or the amount  of necessary workingtime being given, it is selfevident that the greater  the variable capital, the greater would be the mass of the value produced  and of the surplus-value. If the limit of the working-day is given, and  also the limit of its necessary constituent, the mass of value  and surplus-value that an individual capitalist produces, is clearly exclusively  dependent on the mass of labour that he sets in motion. But this, under  the conditions supposed above, depends on the mass of labour-power, or  the number of labourers whom he exploits, and this number in its turn is  determined by the amount of the variable capital advanced. With a given  rate of surplus-value, and a given value of labour-power, therefore, the  masses of surplus-value produced vary directly as the amounts of the variable  capitals advanced. Now we know that the capitalist divides his capital  into two parts. One part he lays out in means of production. This is the  constant part of his capital. The other part he lays out in living labour-power.  This part forms his variable capital. On the basis of the same mode of  social production, the division of capital into constant and variable differs  in different branches of production, and within the same branch of production,  too, this relation changes with changes in the technical conditions and  in the social combinations of the processes of production. But in whatever  proportion a given capital breaks up into a constant and a variable part,  whether the latter is to the former as 1:2 or 1:10 or 1:x, the law just  laid down is not affected by this. For, according to our previous analysis,  the value of the constant capital reappears in the value of the product,  but does not enter into the newly produced value, the newly created value product.  To employ 1,000 spinners, more raw material, spindles, &c., are, of  course, required, than to employ 100. The value of these additional means  of production however may rise, fall, remain unaltered, be large or small;  it has no influence on the process of creation of surplus-value by means  of the labour-powers that put them in motion. The law demonstrated above  now, therefore, takes this form: the masses of value and of surplus-value  produced by different capitals — the value of labour-power being given  and its degree of exploitation being equal — vary directly as the amounts  of the variable constituents of these capitals, i.e., as their constituents  transformed into living labour-power.

Everyone knows that a cotton spinner, who, reckoning the percentage on  the whole of his applied capital, employs much constant and little variable  capital, does not, on account of this, pocket less profit or surplus-value  than a baker, who relatively sets in motion much variable and little constant  capital. For the solution of this apparent contradiction, many intermediate  terms are as yet wanted, as from the standpoint of elementary algebra many  intermediate terms are wanted to understand that 0/0 may represent an actual  magnitude. Classical economy, although not formulating the law, holds instinctively  to it, because it is a necessary consequence of the general law of value.  It tries to rescue the law from collision with contradictory  phenomena by a violent abstraction. It will be seen later how the school of Ricardo has come to grief over this stumbling block. Vulgar economy which, indeed, “has really learnt nothing,” here as everywhere  sticks to appearances in opposition to the law which regulates and explains  them.

If,  e.g., the number of labourers is a million, and the average working-day  of a labourer is 10 hours, the social working day consists of ten million  hours. With a given length of this working day, whether its limits are fixed  physically or socially, the mass of surplus-value can only be increased  by increasing the number of labourers, i.e., of the labouring population.  The growth of population here forms the mathematical limit to the production  of surplus-value by the total social capital. On the contrary, with a given  amount of population, this limit is formed by the possible lengthening  of the working day.

1291,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch11.htm,"From the treatment of the production of surplus-value, so far,  it follows that not every sum of money, or of value, is at pleasure transformable  into capital. To effect this transformation, in fact, a certain minimum  of money or of exchange-value must be presupposed in the hands of the individual  possessor of money or commodities. The minimum of variable capital is the  cost price of a single labour-power, employed the whole year through, day  in, day out, for the production of surplus-value. If this labourer were  in possession of his own means of production, and were satisfied to live  as a labourer, he need not work beyond the time necessary for the reproduction  of his means of subsistence, say 8 hours a day. He would, besides, only  require the means of production sufficient for 8 working-hours. The capitalist,  on the other hand, who makes him do, besides these 8 hours, say 4 hours’  surplus-labour, requires an additional sum of money for furnishing the  additional means of production. On our supposition, however, he would have  to employ two labourers in order to live, on the surplus-value appropriated  daily, as well as, and no better than a labourer, i.e., to be able to satisfy  his necessary wants. In this case the mere maintenance of life would be  the end of his production, not the increase of wealth; but this latter  is implied in capitalist production.  That he may live only twice as well as an ordinary labourer, and besides turn half of the surplus-value produced  into capital, he would have to raise, with the number of labourers, the  minimum of the capital advanced 8 times. Of course he can, like his labourer,  take to work himself, participate directly in the process of production,  but he is then only a hybrid between capitalist and labourer, a “small  master.”  A certain stage of capitalist production necessitates that the  capitalist be able to devote the whole of the time during which he functions  as a capitalist, i.e., as personified capital, to the appropriation  and therefore control of the labour of others, and to the selling of the  products of this labour.

In tanning, e.g.,  he deals with the skins as his simple object of labour. It is not the capitalist  whose skin he tans. But it is different as soon as we deal with the process  of production from the point of view of the process of creation of surplus-value.  The means of production are at once changed into means for the absorption  of the labour of others. It is now no longer the labourer that employs  the means of production, but the means of production that employ  the labourer. Instead of being consumed by him as material elements of  his productive activity, they consume him as the ferment necessary to their  own life-process, and the life-process of capital consists only in its movement  as value constantly expanding, constantly multiplying itself. Furnaces  and workshops that stand idle by night, and absorb no living labour, are  “a mere loss” to the capitalist.

Beyond this, his necessary  labour-time, the labourer, we saw, could continue to work for 2, 3, 4,  6, &c., hours. The rate of surplus-value and the length of the working day  depended on the magnitude of this prolongation. Though the necessary labour-time  was constant, we saw, on the other hand, that the total working day was  variable. Now suppose we have a working day whose length, and whose apportionment  between necessary labour and surplus-labour, are given. Let the whole line  a c, a—b—c represent, for example, a working day of 12 hours; the portion  of a b 10 hours of necessary labour, and the portion b c 2 hours of surplus-labour.

If now, in a c, the working day  of 12 hours, we move the point b to b', b c becomes b' c; the surplus-labour  increases by one half, from 2 hours to 3 hours, although the working day  remains as before at 12 hours. This extension of the surplus labour-time  from b c to b' c, from 2 hours to 3 hours, is, however, evidently impossible,  without a simultaneous contraction of the necessary labour-time from  a b into a b', from 10 hours to 9 hours. The prolongation of the surplus-labour  would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour; or a portion  of the labour-time previously consumed, in reality, for the labourer’s  own benefit, would be converted into labour-time for the benefit of the  capitalist. There would be an alteration, not in the length of the working day,  but in its division into necessary labour-time and surplus labour-time.    ","The
Concept of Relative Surplus-Value"
1316,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm,"On the other hand, it is evident that the duration of the surplus-labour  is given, when the length of the working day, and the value of labour-power,  are given. The value of labour-power, i.e., the labour-time requisite to  produce labour-power, determines the labour-time necessary for the reproduction  of that value. If one working-hour be embodied in sixpence, and the value  of a day’s labour-power be five shillings, the labourer must work 10 hours  a day, in order to replace the value paid by capital for his labour-power,  or to produce an equivalent for the value of his daily necessary means  of subsistence. Given the value of these means of subsistence, the value  of his labour-power is given;  and given the value  of his labour-power, the duration of his necessary labour-time is given.  The duration of the surplus-labour, however, is arrived at, by subtracting  the necessary labour-time from the total working day. Ten hours subtracted  from twelve, leave two, and it is not easy to see, how, under the given  conditions, the surplus-labour can possibly be prolonged beyond two hours.  No doubt, the capitalist can, instead of five shillings, pay the labourer  four shillings and sixpence or even less. For the reproduction of this  value of four shillings and sixpence, nine hours’ labour-time would suffice;  and consequently three hours of surplus-labour, instead of two, would accrue  to the capitalist, and the surplus-value would rise from one shilling to  eighteen-pence. This result, however, would be obtained only by lowering  the wages of the labourer below the value of his labour-power. With the  four shillings and sixpence which he produces in nine hours, he commands  one-tenth less of the necessaries of life than before, and consequently  the proper reproduction of his labour-power is crippled. The surplus-labour  would in this case be prolonged only by an overstepping of its normal limits;  its domain would be extended only by a usurpation of part of the domain  of necessary labour-time. Despite the important part which this method  plays in actual practice, we are excluded from considering it in this place,  by our assumption, that all commodities, including labour-power, are bought  and sold at their full value. Granted this, it follows that the labour-time  necessary for the production of labour-power, or for the reproduction of  its value, cannot be lessened by a fall in the labourer’s wages below the  value of his labour-power, but only by a fall in this value itself. Given  the length of the working day, the prolongation of the surplus-labour must  of necessity originate in the curtailment of the necessary labour-time;  the latter cannot arise from the former. In the example we have taken,  it is necessary that the value of labour-power should actually fall by  one-tenth, in order that the necessary labour-time may be diminished by  one-tenth, i.e., from ten hours to nine, and in order that the surplus  labour may consequently be prolonged from two hours to three.    ","The
Concept of Relative Surplus-Value"
1317,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm,"Such a fall in the value of labour-power implies, however, that  the same necessaries of life which were formerly produced in ten hours,  can now be produced in nine hours. But this is impossible without an increase  in the productiveness of labour. For example, suppose a shoe-maker, with  given tools, makes in one working day of twelve hours, one pair of boots.  If he must make two pairs in the same time, the productiveness of his labour  must be doubled; and this cannot be done, except by an alteration in his  tools or in his mode of working, or in both. Hence, the conditions of production,  i.e., his mode of production, and the labour-process itself, must be revolutionised.  By increase in the productiveness of labour, we mean, generally, an alteration  in the labour-process, of such a kind as to shorten the labour-time socially  necessary for the production of a commodity, and to endow a given quantity  of labour with the power of producing a greater quantity of use-value.   Hitherto in treating of surplus-value, arising from a simple prolongation of the working day, we have assumed the mode of production  to be given and invariable. But when surplus-value has to be produced by  the conversion of necessary labour into surplus-labour, it by no means  suffices for capital to take over the labour-process in the form under  which it has been historically handed down, and then simply to prolong  the duration of that process. The technical and social conditions of the  process, and consequently the very mode of production must be revolutionised,  before the productiveness of labour can be increased. By that means alone  can the value of labour-power be made to sink, and the portion of the working day  necessary for the reproduction of that value, be shortened.  ","The

But the value of a commodity is determined,  not only by the quantity of labour which the labourer directly bestows  upon that commodity, but also by the labour contained in the means of production.  For instance, the value of a pair of boots depends not only on the cobbler’s  labour, but also on the value of the leather, wax, thread, &c. Hence,  a fall in the value of labour-power is also brought about by an increase  in the productiveness of labour, and by a corresponding cheapening of commodities  in those industries which supply the instruments of labour and the raw  material, that form the material elements of the constant capital required  for producing the necessaries of life. But an increase in the productiveness  of labour in those branches of industry which supply neither the necessaries  of life, nor the means of production for such necessaries, leaves the value  of labour-power undisturbed.    ","The

1320,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm,"The cheapened commodity, of course, causes only a pro tanto fall  in the value of labour-power, a fall proportional to the extent of that  commodity’s employment in the reproduction of labour-power. Shirts, for  instance, are a necessary means of subsistence, but are only one out of  many. The totality of the necessaries of life consists, however, of various  commodities, each the product of a distinct industry; and the value of  each of those commodities enters as a component part into the value of  labour-power. This latter value decreases with the decrease of the labour-time  necessary for its reproduction; the total decrease being the sum of all  the different curtailments of labour-time effected in those various and  distinct industries. This general result is treated, here, as if it were  the immediate result directly aimed at in each individual case. Whenever  an individual capitalist cheapens shirts, for instance, by increasing the  productiveness of labour he by no means necessarily aims at reducing the  value of labour-power and shortening, pro tanto the necessary labour-time.  But it is only in so far as he ultimately contributes to this result, that  he assists in raising the general rate of surplus-value.

But this much is clear; a scientific analysis of competition is not possible,  before we have a conception of the inner nature of capital, just as the  apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not intelligible to any but  him, who is acquainted with their real motions, motions which are not directly  perceptible by the senses. Nevertheless, for the better comprehension of  the production of relative surplus-value, we may add the following remarks,  in which we assume nothing more than the results we have already obtained.  ","The
Concept of Relative Surplus-Value"
1322,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm,"If one hour’s labour is embodied in sixpence, a value of six shillings  will be produced in a working day of 12 hours. Suppose, that with the prevailing  productiveness of labour, 12 articles are produced in these 12 hours. Let  the value of the means of production used up in each article be sixpence.  Under these circumstances, each article costs one shilling: sixpence for  the value of the means of production, and sixpence for the value newly  added in working with those means. Now let some one capitalist contrive  to double the productiveness of labour, and to produce in the working day  of 12 hours, 24 instead of 12 such articles. The value of the means of  production remaining the same, the value of each article will fall to ninepence,  made up of sixpence for the value of the means of production and threepence  for the value newly added by the labour. Despite the doubled productiveness  of labour, the day’s labour creates, as before, a new value of six shillings  and no more, which, however, is now spread over twice as many articles.  Of this value each article now has embodied in it 1/24th, instead of 1/12th,  threepence instead of sixpence; or, what amounts to the same thing, only  half an hour’s instead of a whole hour’s labour-time, is now added to the  means of production while they are being transformed into each article.  The individual value of these articles is now below their social value;  in other words, they have cost less labour-time than the great bulk of  the same article produced under the average social conditions. Each article  costs, on an average, one shilling, and represents 2 hours of social labour;  but under the altered mode of production it costs only ninepence, or contains  only 1½ hours’ labour. The real value of a commodity is, however,  not its individual value, but its social value; that is to say, the real  value is not measured by the labour-time that the article in each individual  case costs the producer, but by the labour-time socially required for its  production. If therefore, the capitalist who applies the new method, sells  his commodity at its social value of one shilling, he sells it for threepence  above its individual value, and thus realises an extra surplus-value of  threepence. On the other hand, the working day of 12 hours is, as regards  him, now represented by 24 articles instead of 12. Hence, in order to get  rid of the product of one working day, the demand must be double what it  was, i.e., the market must become twice as extensive. Other things being  equal, his commodities can command a more extended market only by a diminution  of their prices. He will therefore sell them above their individual but  under their social value, say at tenpence each. By this means he still  squeezes an extra surplus-value of one penny out of each. This augmentation  of surplus-value is pocketed by him, whether his commodities belong or  not to the class of necessary means of subsistence that participate in  determining the general value of labour-power. Hence, independently of  this latter circumstance, there is a motive for each individual capitalist  to cheapen his commodities, by increasing the productiveness of labour.    ","The
Concept of Relative Surplus-Value"
1323,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm,"Nevertheless, even in this case, the increased production of surplus-value  arises from the curtailment of the necessary labour-time, and from the  corresponding prolongation of the surplus-labour.  The general rate of surplus-value is, therefore, ultimately affected by  the whole process, only when the increase in the productiveness of labour,  has seized upon those branches of production that are connected with,  and has cheapened those commodities that form part of, the necessary means  of subsistence, and are therefore elements of the value of labour-power.

1324,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm,"The value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productiveness  of labour. And so, too, is the value of labour-power, because it depends  on the values of commodities. Relative surplus-value is, on the contrary,  directly proportional to that productiveness. It rises with rising and  falls with falling productiveness. The value of money being assumed to  be constant, an average social working day of 12 hours always produces  the same new value, six shillings, no matter how this sum may be apportioned  between surplus-value and wages. But if, in consequence of increased productiveness,  the value of the necessaries of life fall, and the value of a day’s labour-power  be thereby reduced from five shillings to three, the surplus-value increases  from one shilling to three. Ten hours were necessary for the reproduction  of the value of the labour-power; now only six are required. Four hours  have been set free, and can be annexed to the domain of surplus-labour.  Hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant tendency,  to heighten the productiveness of labour, in order to cheapen commodities,  and by such cheapening to cheapen the labourer himself.

What alone interests him, is the surplus-value that dwells  in it, and is realisable by sale. Realisation of the surplus-value necessarily  carries with it the refunding of the value that was advanced. Now, since  relative surplus-value increases in direct proportion to the development  of the productiveness of labour, while, on the other hand, the value of  commodities diminishes in the same proportion; since one and the same process  cheapens commodities, and augments the surplus-value contained in them;  we have here the solution of the riddle: why does the capitalist, whose  sole concern is the production of exchange-value, continually strive to  depress the exchange-value of commodities?

The object of all development of  the productiveness of labour, within the limits of capitalist production,  is to shorten that part of the working day, during which the workman must  labour for his own benefit, and by that very shortening, to lengthen the  other part of the day, during which he is at liberty to work gratis for  the capitalist.

With regard to the mode of production itself, manufacture,  in its strict meaning, is hardly to be distinguished, in its earliest stages,  from the handicraft trades of the guilds, otherwise than by the greater  number of workmen simultaneously employed by one and the same individual  capital.

The buildings in which they work, the  store-houses for the raw material, the implements and utensils used simultaneously  or in turns by the workmen; in short, a portion of the means of production,  are now consumed in common. On the one hand, the exchange-value of these  means of production is not increased; for the exchange-value of a commodity  is not raised by its use-value being consumed more thoroughly and to greater  advantage. On the other hand, they are used in common, and therefore on  a larger scale than before. A room where twenty weavers work at twenty  looms must be larger than the room of a single weaver with two assistants.  But it costs less labour to build one workshop for twenty persons than  to build ten to accommodate two weavers each; thus the value of the means  of production that are concentrated for use in common on a large scale  does not increase in direct proportion to the expansion and to the increased  useful effect of those means. When consumed in common, they give up a smaller  part of their value to each single product; partly because the total value  they part with is spread over a greater quantity of products, and partly  because their value, though absolutely greater, is, having regard to their  sphere of action in the process, relatively less than the value of isolated  means of production. Owing to this, the value of a part of the constant  capital falls, and in proportion to the magnitude of the fall, the total  value of the commodity also falls. The effect is the same as if the means  of production had cost less. The economy in their application is  entirely owing to their being consumed in common by a large number of workmen.  Moreover, this character of being necessary conditions of social labour,  a character that distinguishes them from the dispersed and relatively more  costly means of production of isolated, independent labourers, or small  masters, is acquired even when the numerous workmen assembled together  do not assist one another, but merely work side by side. A portion of the  instruments of labour acquires this social character before the labour-process  itself does so.  ",Co-operation

First, as cheapening commodities, and thereby bringing  about a fall in the value of labour-power. Secondly, as altering the ratio  of the surplus-value to the total capital advanced, i.e., to the sum of  the values of the constant and variable capital. The latter aspect will  not be considered until we come to the third book, to which, with the object  of treating them in their proper connexion, we also relegate many other  points that relate to the present question. The march of our analysis compels  this splitting up of the subject-matter, a splitting up that is quite in  keeping with the spirit of capitalist production. For since, in this mode  of production, the workman finds the instruments of labour existing independently  of him as another man’s property, economy in their use appears, with regard  to him, to be a distinct operation, one that does not concern him, and  which, therefore, has no connexion with the methods by which his own personal  productiveness is increased.

For instance, if  a dozen masons place themselves in a row, so as to pass stones from the  foot of a ladder to its summit, each of them does the same thing; nevertheless,  their separate acts form connected parts of one total operation; they are  particular phases, which must be gone through by each stone; and the stones  are thus carried up quicker by the 24 hands of the row of men than they  could be if each man went separately up and down the ladder with his burden.   The object is carried over the same distance in a shorter time. Again, a combination of labour occurs whenever a building,  for instance, is taken in hand on different sides simultaneously; although  here also the co-operating masons are doing the same, or the same kind  of work. The 12 masons, in their collective working-day of 144 hours, make  much more progress with the building than one mason could make working  for 12 days, or 144 hours. The reason is, that a body of men working in  concert has hands and eyes both before and behind, and is, to a certain  degree, omnipresent. The various parts of the work progress simultaneously.

If the work be complicated, then the mere number  of the men who co-operate allows of the various operations being apportioned  to different hands, and, consequently, of being carried on simultaneously.  The time necessary for the completion of the whole work is thereby shortened.    ",Co-operation

For instance, if a flock of sheep has to be shorn, or a field  of wheat to be cut and harvested, the quantity and quality of the product  depends on the work being begun and ended within a certain time. In these  cases, the time that ought to be taken by the process is prescribed, just  as it is in herring fishing. A single person cannot carve a working-day  of more than, say 12 hours, out of the natural day, but 100 men co-operating  extend the working-day to 1,200 hours. The shortness of the time allowed  for the work is compensated for by the large mass of labour thrown upon  the field of production at the decisive moment. The completion of the task  within the proper time depends on the simultaneous application of numerous  combined working-days; the amount of useful effect depends on the number  of labourers; this number, however, is always smaller than the number of  isolated labourers required to do the same amount of work in the same period.   ",Co-operation

On the other hand,  while extending the scale of production, it renders possible a relative  contraction of the arena. This contraction of arena simultaneous with,  and arising from, extension of scale, whereby a number of useless expenses  are cut down, is owing to the conglomeration of labourers, to the aggregation  of various processes, and to the concentration of the means of production.

Whether the combined working-day, in a given case, acquires this  increased productive power, because it heightens the mechanical force of  labour, or extends its sphere of action over a greater space, or contracts  the field of production relatively to the scale of production, or at the  critical moment sets large masses of labour to work, or excites emulation  between individuals and raises their animal spirits, or impresses on the  similar operations carried on by a number of men the stamp of continuity  and many-sidedness, or performs simultaneously different operations, or  economises the means of production by use in common, or lends to individual  labour the character of average social labour whichever of these  be the cause of the increase, the special productive power of the combined  working-day is, under all circumstances, the social productive power of  labour, or the productive power of social labour. This power is due to  co-operation itself. When the labourer co-operates systematically with  others, he strips off the fetters of his individuality, and develops the  capabilities of his species.  ",Co-operation

Hence wage-labourers cannot co-operate, unless they are employed  simultaneously by the same capital, the same capitalist, and unless therefore  their labour-powers are bought simultaneously by him. The total value of  these labour-powers, or the amount of the wages of these labourers for  a day, or a week, as the case may be, must be ready in the pocket of the  capitalist, before the workmen are assembled for the process of production.  The payment of 300 workmen at once, though only for one day, requires a  greater outlay of capital, than does the payment of a smaller number of  men, week by week, during a whole year. Hence the number of the labourers  that co-operate, or the scale of co-operation, depends, in the first instance,  on the amount of capital that the individual capitalist can spare for the  purchase of labour-power; in other words, on the extent to which a single  capitalist has command over the means of subsistence of a number of labourers.

The value and quantity of the instruments of labour used in common  do not, it is true, increase at the same rate as the number of workmen,  but they do increase very considerably. Hence, concentration of large masses  of the means of production in the hands of individual capitalists, is a  material condition for the co-operation of wage-labourers, and the extent  of the co-operation or the scale of production, depends on the extent of  this concentration.

He is at liberty  to set the 100 men to work, without letting them co-operate. He pays them  the value of 100 independent labour-powers, but he does not pay for the  combined labour-power of the hundred. Being independent of each other,  the labourers are isolated persons, who enter into relations with the capitalist,  but not with one another. This co-operation begins only with the labour-process,  but they have then ceased to belong to themselves. On entering that process,  they become incorporated with capital. As co-operators, as members of a  working organism, they are but special modes of existence of capital. Hence,  the productive power developed by the labourer when working in co-operation,  is the productive power of capital. This power is developed gratuitously,  whenever the workmen are placed under given conditions, and it is capital  that places them under such conditions.

That period, roughly speaking, extends from  the middle of the 16th to the last third of the 18th century.  ","Division

of Labour and Manufacture"
1403,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"(1.) By the assemblage, in one workshop under the control of a single  capitalist, of labourers belonging to various independent handicrafts,  but through whose hands a given article must pass on its way to completion.  A carriage, for example, was formerly the product of the labour of a great  number of independent artificers, such as wheelwrights, harness-makers,  tailors, locksmiths, upholsterers, turners, fringe-makers, glaziers, painters,  polishers, gilders, &c. In the manufacture of carriages, however, all  these different artificers are assembled in one building where they work  into one another’s hands. It is true that a carriage cannot be gilt before  it has been made. But if a number of carriages are being made simultaneously,  some may be in the hands of the gilders while others are going through  an earlier process. So far, we are still in the domain of simple co-operation,  which finds its materials ready to hand in the shape of men and things.  But very soon an important change takes place. The tailor, the locksmith,  and the other artificers, being now exclusively occupied in carriage-making,  each gradually loses, through want of practice, the ability to carry on,  to its full extent, his old handicraft. But, on the other hand, his activity  now confined in one groove, assumes the form best adapted to the narrowed  sphere of action. At first, carriage manufacture is a combination of various  independent handicrafts. By degrees, it becomes the splitting up of carriage-making  into its various detail processes, each of which crystallises into  the exclusive function of a particular workman, the manufacture, as a whole,  being carried on by the men in conjunction. In the same way, cloth manufacture,  as also a whole series of other manufactures, arose by combining different  handicrafts together under the control of a single capitalist.  ","Division
of Labour and Manufacture"
1404,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"(2.) Manufacture also arises in a way exactly the reverse of this –  namely, by one capitalist employing simultaneously in one workshop a number  of artificers, who all do the same, or the same kind of work, such as making  paper, type, or needles. This is co-operation in its most elementary form.  Each of these artificers (with the help, perhaps, of one or two apprentices),  makes the entire commodity, and he consequently performs in succession  all the operations necessary for its production. He still works in his  old handicraft-like way. But very soon external circumstances cause a different  use to be made of the concentration of the workmen on one spot, and of  the simultaneousness of their work. An increased quantity of the article  has perhaps to be delivered within a given time. The work is therefore  re-distributed. Instead of each man being allowed to perform all the various  operations in succession, these operations are changed into disconnected,  isolated ones, carried on side by side; each is assigned to a different  artificer, and the whole of them together are performed simultaneously  by the co-operating workmen. This accidental repartition gets repeated,  develops advantages of its own, and gradually ossifies into a systematic  division of labour. The commodity, from being the individual product of  an independent artificer, becomes the social product of a union of artificers,  each of whom performs one, and only one, of the constituent partial operations.  The same operations which, in the case of a papermaker belonging to a German  Guild, merged one into the other as the successive acts of one artificer,  became in the Dutch paper manufacture so many partial operations carried  on side by side by numerous co-operating labourers. The needlemaker of  the Nuremberg Guild was the cornerstone on which the English needle  manufacture was raised. But while in Nuremberg that single artificer performed  a series of perhaps 20 operations one after another, in England it was  not long before there were 20 needlemakers side by side, each performing  one alone of those 20 operations, and in consequence of further experience,  each of those 20 operations was again split up, isolated, and made the  exclusive function of a separate workman.  ","Division

1405,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"The mode in which manufacture arises, its growth out of handicrafts,  is therefore two-fold. On the one hand, it arises from the union of various  independent handicrafts, which become stripped of their independence and  specialised to such an extent as to be reduced to mere supplementary partial  processes in the production of one particular commodity. On the other hand,  it arises from the co-operation of artificers of one handicraft; it splits  up that particular handicraft into its various detail operations, isolating,  and making these operations independent of one another up to the point  where each becomes the exclusive function of a particular labourer. On  the one hand, therefore, manufacture either introduces division of labour  into a process of production, or further develops that division; on the  other hand, it unites together handicrafts that were formerly separate.  But whatever may have been its particular starting-point, its final form  is invariably the same – a productive mechanism whose parts are human beings.  ","Division
of Labour and Manufacture"
1406,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"For a proper understanding of the division of labour in manufacture,  it is essential that the following points be firmly grasped. First, the  decomposition of a process of production into its various successive steps  coincides, here, strictly with the resolution of a handicraft into its  successive manual operations. Whether complex or simple, each operation  has to be done by hand, retains the character of a handicraft, and is therefore  dependent on the strength, skill, quickness, and sureness, of the individual  workman in handling his tools. The handicraft continues to be the basis.  This narrow technical basis excludes a really scientific analysis of any  definite process of industrial production, since it is still a condition  that each detail process gone through by the product must be capable of  being done by hand and of forming, in its way, a separate handicraft. It  is just because handicraft skill continues, in this way, to be the foundation  of the process of production, that each workman becomes exclusively assigned  to a partial function, and that for the rest of his life, his labour-power  is turned into the organ of this detail function.  ","Division

1407,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm," Secondly, this division of labour is a particular sort of co-operation,  and many of its advantages spring from the general character of co-operation,  and not from this particular form of it.  ","Division
of Labour and Manufacture"
1410,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"If we now go more into detail, it is, in the first  place, clear that a labourer who all his life performs one and the same  simple operation, converts his whole body into the automatic, specialised  implement of that operation. Consequently, he takes less time in doing  it, than the artificer who performs a whole series of operations in succession.  But the collective labourer, who constitutes the living mechanism of manufacture,  is made up solely of such specialised detail labourers. Hence, in comparison  with the independent handicraft, more is produced in a given time, or the  productive power of labour is increased.  ","Division

1411,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"Manufacture, in fact, produces the skill of the detail labourer,  by reproducing, and systematically driving to an extreme within the workshop,  the naturally developed differentiation of trades which it found ready  to hand in society at large. On the other hand, the conversion of fractional  work into the life-calling of one man, corresponds to the tendency shown  by earlier societies, to make trades hereditary; either to petrify them  into castes, or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual  a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes,  to ossify them into guilds. Castes and guilds arise from the action of  the same natural law, that regulates the differentiation of plants and  animals into species and varieties, except that, when a certain degree  of development has been reached, the heredity of castes and the exclusiveness  of guilds are ordained as a law of society.

Yet they are produced without capital, machinery, division  of labour, or any of those means which give such facilities to the manufacturing  interest of Europe. The weaver is merely a detached individual, working  a web when ordered of a customer, and with a loom of the rudest construction,  consisting sometimes of a few branches or bars of wood, put roughly together.  There is even no expedient for rolling up the warp; the loom must therefore  be kept stretched to its full length, and becomes so inconveniently large,  that it cannot be contained within the hut of the manufacturer, who is  therefore compelled to ply his trade in the open air, where it is interrupted  by every vicissitude of the weather.” ","Division

1414,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"An artificer, who performs one after another the various fractional  operations in the production of a finished article, must at one time change  his place, at another his tools. The transition from one operation to another  interrupts the flow of his labour, and creates, so to say, gaps in his  working-day. These gaps close up so soon as he is tied to one and the same  operation all day long; they vanish in proportion as the changes in his  work diminish. The resulting increased productive power is owing either  to an increased expenditure of labour-power in a given time i.e., to increased  intensity of labour or to a decrease in the amount of labour-power unproductively  consumed. The extra expenditure of power, demanded by every transition  from rest to motion, is made up for by prolonging the duration of the normal  velocity when once acquired. On the other hand, constant labour of one  uniform kind disturbs the intensity and flow of a man’s animal spirits,  which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity.  ","Division

1415,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"The productiveness of labour depends not only on the proficiency  of the workman, but on the perfection of his tools. Tools of the same kind,  such as knives, drills, gimlets, hammers, &c., may be employed  in different processes; and the same tool may serve various purposes in  a single process. But so soon as the different operations of a labour-process  are disconnected the one from the other, and each fractional operation  acquires in the hands of the detail labourer a suitable and peculiar form,  alterations become necessary in the implements that previously served more  than one purpose. The direction taken by this change is determined by the  difficulties experienced in consequence of the unchanged form of the implement.  Manufacture is characterised by the differentiation of the instruments  of labour – a differentiation whereby implements of a given sort acquire  fixed shapes, adapted to each particular application, and by the specialisation  of those instruments, giving to each special implement its full play only  in the hands of a specific detail labourer. In Birmingham alone 500 varieties  of hammers are produced, and not only is each adapted to one particular  process, but several varieties often serve exclusively for the different  operations in one and the same process. The manufacturing period simplifies,  improves, and multiplies the implements of labour, by adapting them to  the exclusively special functions of each detail labourer.  It thus creates at the same time one of the material conditions for the  existence of machinery, which consists of a combination of simple instruments.  ","Division

1420,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"The organisation of manufacture has two fundamental  forms which, in spite of occasional blending, are essentially different  in kind, and, moreover, play very distinct parts in the subsequent transformation  of manufacture into modern industry carried on by machinery. This double  character arises from the nature of the article produced. This article  either results from the mere mechanical fitting together of partial products  made independently, or owes its completed shape to a series of connected  processes and manipulations.

1421,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"A locomotive, for instance, consists of more than 5,000  independent parts. It cannot, however, serve as an example of the first  kind of genuine manufacture, for it is a structure produced by modern mechanical  industry. But a watch can; and William Petty used it to illustrate the  division of labour in manufacture. Formerly the individual work of a Nuremberg  artificer, the watch has been transformed into the social product of an  immense number of detail labourers, such as mainspring makers, dial makers,  spiral spring makers, jewelled hole makers, ruby lever makers, hand makers,  case makers, screw makers, gilders, with numerous subdivisions, such as  wheel makers (brass and steel separate), pin makers, movement makers, acheveur  de pignon (fixes the wheels on the axles, polishes the facets, &c.),  pivot makers, planteur de finissage (puts the wheels and springs in the  works), finisseur de barillet (cuts teeth in the wheels, makes the holes  of the right size, &c.), escapement makers, cylinder makers for cylinder  escapements, escapement wheel makers, balance wheel makers, raquette makers  (apparatus for regulating the watch), the planteur d’échappement  (escapement maker proper); then the repasseur de barillet (finishes the  box for the spring, &c.), steel polishers, wheel polishers, screw polishers,  figure painters, dial enamellers (melt the enamel on the copper), fabricant  de pendants (makes the ring by which the case is hung), finisseur de charnière  (puts the brass hinge in the cover, &c.), faiseur de secret (puts in  the springs that open the case), graveur, ciseleur, polisseur de boîte,  &c., &c., and last of all the repasseur, who fits together the  whole watch and hands it over in a going state. Only a few parts of the  watch pass through several hands; and all these membra disjecta come together  for the first time in the hand that binds them into one mechanical whole.  This external relation between the finished product, and its various and  diverse elements makes it, as well in this case as in the case of all similar  finished articles, a matter of chance whether the detail labourers are  brought together in one workshop or not. The detail operations may further  be carried on like so many independent handicrafts, as they are in the  Cantons of Vaud and Neufchâtel; while in Geneva there exist large  watch manufactories where the detail labourers directly co-operate under  the control of a single capitalist. And even in the latter case the dial, the springs, and the case, are seldom made in the factory itself. To carry  on the trade as a manufacture, with concentration of workmen, is, in the  watch trade, profitable only under exceptional conditions, because competition  is greater between the labourers who desire to work at home, and because  the splitting up of the work into a number of heterogeneous processes,  permits but little use of the instruments of labour in common, and the  capitalist, by scattering the work, saves the outlay on workshops,  &c.  ","Division

1422,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"The second kind of manufacture, its perfected form, produces articles  that go through connected phases of development, through a series of processes  step by step, like the wire in the manufacture of needles, which passes  through the hands of 72 and sometimes even 92 different detail workmen.     ","Division

1423,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"In so far as such a manufacture, when first started, combines  scattered handicrafts, it lessens the space by which the various phases  of production are separated from each other. The time taken in passing  from one stage to another is shortened, so is the labour that effectuates  this passage.  ","Division
of Labour and Manufacture"
1424,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"If we confine our attention to some particular lot of raw  materials, of rags, for instance, in paper manufacture, or of wire in needle  manufacture, we perceive that it passes in succession through a series  of stages in the hands of the various detail workmen until completion.  On the other hand, if we look at the workshop as a whole, we see the raw  material in all the stages of its production at the same time. The collective  labourer, with one set of his many hands armed with one kind of tools,  draws the wire, with another set, armed with different tools, he, at the  same time, straightens it, with another, he cuts it, with another, points  it, and so on. The different detail processes, which were successive in  time, have become simultaneous, go on side by side in space. Hence, production  of a greater quantum of finished commodities in a given time.  This simultaneity, it is true, is due to the general co-operative form of the process as a whole; but Manufacture not only finds the conditions  for co-operation ready to hand, it also, to some extent, creates them by  the sub-division of handicraft labour. On the other hand, it accomplishes  this social organisation of the labour-process only by riveting each labourer  to a single fractional detail.  ","Division
of Labour and Manufacture"
1425,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"Since the fractional product of each detail labourer is, at the  same time, only a particular stage in the development of one and the same  finished article, each labourer, or each group of labourers, prepares the  raw material for another labourer or group. The result of the labour of  the one is the starting-point for the labour of the other. The one workman  therefore gives occupation directly to the other. The labour-time necessary in each partial process, for attaining the desired effect, is learnt by  experience; and the mechanism of Manufacture, as a whole, is based on the  assumption that a given result will be obtained in a given time. It is  only on this assumption that the various supplementary labour-processes  can proceed uninterruptedly, simultaneously, and side by side. It is clear  that this direct dependence of the operations, and therefore of the labourers,  on each other, compels each one of them to spend on his work no more than  the necessary time, and thus a continuity, uniformity, regularity, order,   ","Division

1426,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"Different operations take, however, unequal periods, and yield  therefore, in equal times unequal quantities of fractional products. If,  therefore, the same labourer has, day after day, to perform the same operation,  there must be a different number of labourers for each operation; for instance,  in type manufacture, there are four founders and two breakers to one rubber:  the founder casts 2,000 type an hour, the breaker breaks up 4,000, and  the rubber polishes 8,000. Here we have again the principle of co-operation  in its simplest form, the simultaneous employment of many doing the same  thing; only now, this principle is the expression of an organic relation.  The division of labour, as carried out in Manufacture, not only simplifies  and multiplies the qualitatively different parts of the social collective  labourer, but also creates a fixed mathematical relation or ratio which  regulates the quantitative extent of those parts i.e., the relative number  of labourers, or the relative size of the group of labourers, for each  detail operation. It develops, along with the qualitative sub-division  of the social labour-process, a quantitative rule and proportionality for  that process.    ","Division

There is this to boot, that the same individual can do certain kinds of work just as  well on a large as on a small scale; for instance, the labour of superintendence,  the carriage of the fractional product from one stage to the next, &c.  The isolation of such functions, their allotment to a particular labourer,  does not become advantageous till after an increase in the number  of labourers employed; but this increase must affect every group proportionally.

1428,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm,"The isolated group of labourers to whom any particular detail  function is assigned, is made up of homogeneous elements, and is one of  the constituent parts of the total mechanism. In many manufactures, however,  the group itself is an organised body of labour, the total mechanism being  a repetition or multiplication of these elementary organisms. Take, for  instance, the manufacture of glass bottles. It may be resolved into three  essentially different stages. First, the preliminary stage, consisting  of the preparation of the components of the glass, mixing the sand and  lime, &c., and melting them into a fluid mass of glass.  Various detail labourers are employed in this first stage, as also in the final one of removing the bottles from the drying furnace, sorting and  packing them, &c. In the middle, between these two stages, comes the  glass melting proper, the manipulation of the fluid mass. At each mouth  of the furnace, there works a group, called “the hole,” consisting of one  bottlemaker or finisher, one blower, one gatherer, one putter-up or whetter-off,  and one taker-in. These five detail workers are so many special organs  of a single working organism that acts only as a whole, and therefore can  operate only by the direct co-operation of the whole five. The whole body  is paralysed if but one of its members be wanting. But a glass furnace  has several openings (in England from 4 to 6), each of which contains an  earthenware melting-pot full of molten glass, and employs a similar five-membered  group of workers. The organisation of each group is based on division of  labour, but the bond between the different groups is simple co-operation,  which, by using in common one of the means of production, the furnace,  causes it to be more economically consumed. Such a furnace, with its 4-6  groups, constitutes a glass house; and a glass manufactory comprises a  number of such glass houses, together with the apparatus and workmen requisite  for the preparatory and final stages.

The larger English glass manufacturers, for instance, make  their own earthenware melting-pots, because, on the quality of these depends,  to a great extent, the success or failure of the process. The manufacture  of one of the means of production is here united with that of the product.  On the other hand, the manufacture of the product may be united with other  manufactures, of which that product is the raw material, or with the products  of which it is itself subsequently mixed. Thus, we find the manufacture  of flint glass combined with that of glass cutting and brass founding;  the latter for the metal settings of various articles of glass. The various  manufactures so combined form more or less separate departments of a larger  manufacture, but are at the same time independent processes, each with  its own division of labour. In spite of the many advantages offered by  this combination of manufactures, it never grows into a complete technical  system on its own foundation. That happens only on its transformation into  an industry carried on by machinery.      ","Division

In one operation he must exert more strength,  in another more skill, in another more attention; and the same individual  does not possess all these qualities in an equal degree. After Manufacture has once separated, made independent, and isolated the various operations, the labourers are divided, classified, and grouped according to their predominating  qualities. If their natural endowments are, on the one hand, the foundation  on which the division of labour is built up, on the other hand, Manufacture,  once introduced, develops in them new powers that are by nature fitted  only for limited and special functions. The collective labourer now possesses,  in an equal degree of excellence, all the qualities requisite for production,  and expends them in the most economical manner, by exclusively employing  all his organs, consisting of particular labourers, or groups of labourers,  in performing their special functions.

If, on the one hand, the individual labourers are appropriated  and annexed for life by a limited function; on the other hand, the various  operations of the hierarchy are parcelled out among the labourers according  to both their natural and their acquired capabilities.  An exception to this law holds good whenever the decomposition of the labour-process begets new and comprehensive functions, that either had no place at all,  or only a very modest one, in handicrafts. The fall in the value of labour-power,  caused by the disappearance or diminution of the expenses of apprenticeship,  implies a direct increase of surplus-value for the benefit of capital;  for everything that shortens the necessary labour-time required for the  reproduction of labour-power, extends the domain of surplus-labour.

Within  a family,  and after further development within  a tribe, there springs up naturally a division of labour, caused by differences  of sex and age, a division that is consequently based on a purely physiological  foundation, which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of the  community, by the increase of population, and more especially, by the conflicts  between different tribes, and the subjugation of one tribe by another.  On the other hand, as I have before remarked, the exchange of products  springs up at the points where different families, tribes, communities,  come in contact; for, in the beginning of civilisation, it is not private  individuals but families, tribes, &c., that meet on an independent  footing. Different communities find different means of production, and  different means of subsistence in their natural environment. Hence, their  modes of production, and of living, and their products are different. It  is this spontaneously developed difference which, when different communities  come in contact, calls forth the mutual exchange of products, and the consequent  gradual conversion of those products into commodities. Exchange does not  create the differences between the spheres of production, but brings what  are already different into relation, and thus converts them into more or  less inter-dependent branches of the collective production of an enlarged  society. In the latter case, the social division of labour arises from  the exchange between spheres of production, that are originally distinct  and independent of one another. In the former, where the physiological  division of labour is the starting-point, the particular organs of a compact  whole grow loose, and break off, principally owing to the exchange of commodities  with foreign communities, and then isolate themselves so far, that the  sole bond, still connecting the various kinds of work, is the exchange  of the products as commodities. In the one case, it is the making dependent  what was before independent; in the other case, the making independent  what was before dependent.    ","Division

The analogy  appears most indisputable where there is an invisible bond uniting the  various branches of trade. For instance the cattle-breeder produces hides,  the tanner makes the hides into leather, and the shoemaker, the leather  into boots. Here the thing produced by each of them is but a step towards  the final form, which is the product of all their labours combined. There are, besides, all the various industries that supply the cattle-breeder, the tanner, and the shoemaker with the means of production. Now it is quite  possible to imagine, with Adam Smith, that the difference between the above  social division of labour, and the division in manufacture, is merely subjective,  exists merely for the observer, who, in a manufacture, can see with one  glance, all the numerous operations being performed on one spot, while  in the instance given above, the spreading out of the work over great areas,  and the great number of people employed in each branch of labour, obscure  the connexion.  more or less preserves the  conditions of existence of every species. The same bourgeois mind which  praises division of labour in the workshop, life-long annexation of the  labourer to a partial operation, and his complete subjection to capital,  as being an organisation of labour that increases its productiveness – that  same bourgeois mind denounces with equal vigour every conscious attempt  to socially control and regulate the process of production, as an  inroad upon such sacred things as the rights of property, freedom and unrestricted  play for the bent of the individual capitalist.

Occupying areas of  from 100 up to several thousand acres, each forms a compact whole producing  all it requires. The chief part of the products is destined for direct  use by the community itself, and does not take the form of a commodity.  Hence, production here is independent of that division of labour brought  about, in Indian society as a whole, by means of the exchange of commodities.  It is the surplus alone that becomes a commodity, and a portion of even  that, not until it has reached the hands of the State, into whose hands  from time immemorial a certain quantity of these products has found its  way in the shape of rent in kind. The constitution of these communities  varies in different parts of India. In those of the simplest form, the  land is tilled in common, and the produce divided among the members. At  the same time, spinning and weaving are carried on in each family as subsidiary  industries. Side by side with the masses thus occupied with one and the  same work, we find the “chief inhabitant,” who is judge, police, and tax-gatherer  in one; the book-keeper, who keeps the accounts of the tillage and registers  everything relating thereto; another official, who prosecutes criminals,  protects strangers travelling through and escorts them to the next village;  the boundary man, who guards the boundaries against neighbouring communities;  the water-overseer, who distributes the water from the common tanks for  irrigation; the Brahmin, who conducts the religious services; the schoolmaster,  who on the sand teaches the children reading and writing; the calendar-Brahmin,  or astrologer, who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seed-time  and harvest, and for every other kind of agricultural work; a smith and  a carpenter, who make and repair all the agricultural implements; the potter,  who makes all the pottery of the village; the barber, the washerman, who  washes clothes, the silversmith, here and there the poet, who in some communities  replaces the silversmith, in others the schoolmaster. This dozen of individuals  is maintained at the expense of the whole community. If the population increases, a new community is founded, on the pattern of the old one, on  unoccupied land. The whole mechanism discloses a systematic division of  labour; but a division like that in manufactures is impossible, since the  smith and the carpenter, &c., find an unchanging market, and at the  most there occur, according to the sizes of the villages, two or three  of each, instead of one.  –  this simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of Asiatic societies,  an unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution  and refounding of Asiatic States, and the never-ceasing changes of dynasty.

Moreover, he could  not employ his journeymen in many other handicrafts than the one in which  he was a master. The guilds zealously repelled every encroachment by the  capital of merchants, the only form of free capital with which they came  in contact. A merchant could buy every kind of commodity, but labour as  a commodity he could not buy. He existed only on sufferance, as a dealer  in the products of the handicrafts. If circumstances called for a further  division of labour, the existing guilds split themselves up into varieties,  or founded new guilds by the side of the old ones; all this, however, without  concentrating various handicrafts in a single workshop. Hence, the guild  organisation, however much it may have contributed by separating, isolating,  and perfecting the handicrafts, to create the material conditions for the  existence of manufacture, excluded division of labour in the workshop.  On the whole, the labourer and his means of production remained closely  united, like the snail with its shell, and thus there was wanting the principal  basis of manufacture, the separation of the labourer from his means of  production, and the conversion of these means into capital.

But the division of labour  in manufacture makes this increase in the number of workmen a technical  necessity. The minimum number that any given capitalist is bound to employ  is here prescribed by the previously established division of labour. On  the other hand, the advantages of further division are obtainable only  by adding to the number of workmen, and this can be done only by adding  multiples of the various detail groups. But an increase in the variable  component of the capital employed necessitates an increase in its constant  component, too, in the workshops, implements, &c., and, in particular,  in the raw material, the call for which grows quicker than the number  of workmen. The quantity of it consumed in a given time, by a given amount  of labour, increases in the same ratio as does the productive power of  that labour in consequence of its division. Hence, it is a law, based on  the very nature of manufacture, that the minimum amount of capital, which  is bound to be in the hands of each capitalist, must keep increasing; in  other words, that the transformation into capital of the social means of  production and subsistence must keep extending.

Vacheron & Constantin, in which machinery has been employed  with success, produces at the most three or four different varieties of  size and form.","Division

As will be seen more in detail in the fourth book of this work, Adam Smith has not established a single new  proposition relating to division of labour. What, however, characterises  him as the political economist par excellence of the period of Manufacture,  is the stress he lays on division of labour. The subordinate part which  he assigns to machinery gave occasion in the early days of modern mechanical  industry to the polemic of Lauderdale, and, at a later period, to that  of Ure. A. Smith also confounds differentiation of the instruments of labour,  in which the detail labourers themselves took an active part, with the  invention of machinery; in this latter, it is not the workmen in manufactories,  but learned men, handicraftsman, and even peasants (Brindley), who play  a part.","Division

Ure says,   “This appropriation ... to each, a workman of appropriate value and cost  was naturally assigned, forms the very essence of division of labour.”   On the other hand, he describes this division as “adaptation of labour  to the different talents of men,” and lastly, characterises the whole manufacturing  system as “a system for the division or gradation of labour,” as “the division  of labour into degrees of skill,” &c.

In manufacture proper, he says, the division of labour appears to be greater, because “those employed in  every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same  workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.

One of the new taxes devised at Washington during the civil  war, was the duty of 6% “on all industrial products.” Question: What is  an industrial product? Answer of the legislature: A thing is produced “when  it is made,” and it is made when it is ready for sale. Now, for one example  out of many. The New York and Philadelphia manufacturers had previously  been in the habit of “making” umbrellas with all their belongings. But  since an umbrella is a mixtum compositum of very heterogeneous parts,  by degrees these parts became the products of various separate industries,  carried on independently in different places. They entered as separate  commodities into the umbrella manufactory, where they were fitted together.  The Yankees have given to articles thus fitted together, the name of “assembled  articles,” a name they deserve, for being an assemblage of taxes. Thus  the umbrella “assembles,” first, 6% on the price of each of its elements,  and a further 6% on its own total price.","Division

Xenophon says, it is not only an honour to receive food from the table of the King of Persia, but such food  is much more tasty than other food. “And there is nothing wonderful in  this, for as the other arts are brought to special perfection in the great  towns, so the royal food is prepared in a special way. For in the small  towns the same man makes bedsteads, doors, ploughs, and tables: often,  too, he builds houses into the bargain, and is quite content if he finds  custom sufficient for his sustenance. It is altogether impossible for a  man who does so many things to do them all well. But in the great towns,  where each can find many buyers, one trade is sufficient to maintain the  man who carries it on. Nay, there is often not even need of one complete  trade, but one man makes shoes for men, another for women. Here and there  one man gets a living by sewing, another by cutting out shoes; one does  nothing but cut out clothes, another nothing but sew the pieces together.  It follows necessarily then, that he who does the simplest kind of work,  undoubtedly does it better than anyone else. So it is with the art of cooking.”   (Xen. Cyrop. I. viii., c. 2.)

Like every other increase in the productiveness of labour, machinery is intended to cheapen commodities, and, by shortening that portion of  the working-day, in which the labourer works for himself, to lengthen the  other portion that he gives, without an equivalent, to the capitalist.  In short, it is a means for producing surplus-value.","Machinery

Our first inquiry then is, how the instruments of labour are  converted from tools into machines, or what is the difference between a  machine and the implements of a handicraft? We are only concerned here  with striking and general characteristics; for epochs in the history of  society are no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of  demarcation, than are geological epochs.

They see no essential difference between them, and even  give the name of machine to the simple mechanical powers, the lever, the  inclined plane, the screw, the wedge, &c.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1553,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"All fully developed machinery consists of three essentially different  parts, the motor mechanism, the transmitting mechanism, and finally the  tool or working machine. The motor mechanism is that which puts the  whole in motion. It either generates its own motive power, like the steam-engine,  the caloric engine, the electromagnetic machine, &c., or it receives  its impulse from some already existing natural force, like the water-wheel  from a head of water, the wind-mill from wind, &c. The transmitting  mechanism, composed of fly-wheels, shafting, toothed wheels, pullies, straps,  ropes, bands, pinions, and gearing of the most varied kinds, regulates  the motion, changes its form where necessary, as for instance, from linear  to circular, and divides and distributes it among the working machines.  These two first parts of the whole mechanism are there, solely for putting  the working machines in motion, by means of which motion the subject of  labour is seized upon and modified as desired. The tool or working machine  is that part of the machinery with which the industrial revolution of the  18th century started. And to this day it constantly serves as such a starting-point,  whenever a handicraft, or a manufacture, is turned into an industry carried  on by machinery.     ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1554,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"On a closer examination of the working machine proper, we find  in it, as a general rule, though often, no doubt, under very altered forms,  the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsman or manufacturing workman;  with this difference, that instead of being human implements, they are  the implements of a mechanism, or mechanical implements. Either the entire  machine is only a more or less altered mechanical edition of the old handicraft  tool, as, for instance, the power-loom, The machine proper is therefore a mechanism that, after being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operations  that were formerly done by the workman with similar tools. Whether the  motive power is derived from man, or from some other machine, makes no  difference in this respect. From the moment that the tool proper is taken  from man, and fitted into a mechanism, a machine takes the place  of a mere implement. The difference strikes one at once, even in those  cases where man himself continues to be the prime mover. The number of  implements that he himself can use simultaneously, is limited by the number  of his own natural instruments of production, by the number of his bodily  organs. In Germany, they tried at first to make one spinner work two spinning-wheels,  that is, to work simultaneously with both hands and both feet. This was  too difficult. Later, a treddle spinning-wheel with two spindles was invented,  but adepts in spinning, who could spin two threads at once, were almost  as scarce as two-headed men. The Jenny, on the other hand, even at its  very birth, spun with 12-18 spindles, and the stocking-loom knits with  many thousand needles at once. The number of tools that a machine can bring  into play simultaneously, is from the very first emancipated from the organic  limits that hedge in the tools of a handicraftsman.     ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1555,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"In many manual implements the distinction between man as mere  motive power, and man as the workman or operator properly so called, is  brought into striking contrast. For instance, the foot is merely the prime  mover of the spinning-wheel, while the hand, working with the spindle,  and drawing and twisting, performs the real operation of spinning. It is  this last part of the handicraftsman’s implement that is first seized upon  by the industrial revolution, leaving to the workman, in addition to his  new labour of watching the machine with his eyes and correcting its mistakes  with his hands, the merely mechanical part of being the moving power. On  the other hand, implements, in regard to which man has always acted as  a simple motive power, as, for instance, by turning the crank of a mill,   did not give  rise to any industrial revolution. It was, on the contrary, the invention  of machines that made a revolution in the form of steam-engines necessary.  As soon as man, instead of working with an implement on the subject of  his labour, becomes merely the motive power of an implement-machine, it  is a mere accident that motive power takes the disguise of human muscle;  and it may equally well take the form of wind, water or steam. Of course,  this does not prevent such a change of form from producing great technical  alterations in the mechanism that was originally constructed to be driven  by man alone. Now-a-days, all machines that have their way to make, such  as sewing-machines, bread-making machines, &c., are, unless from their  very nature their use on a small scale is excluded, constructed to be driven  both by human and by purely mechanical motive power.    ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1556,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The machine, which is the starting-point of the industrial revolution,  supersedes the workman, who handles a single tool, by a mechanism operating  with a number of similar tools, and set in motion by a single motive power,  whatever the form of that power may be.  Here we  have the machine, but only as an elementary factor of production by machinery.    ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1557,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Increase in the size of the machine, and in the number of its  working tools, calls for a more massive mechanism to drive it; and this  mechanism requires, in order to overcome its resistance, a mightier moving  power than that of man, apart from the fact that man is a very imperfect  instrument for producing uniform continued motion. But assuming that he  is acting simply as a motor, that a machine has taken the place of his  tool, it is evident that he can be replaced by natural forces. Of all the  great motors handed down from the manufacturing period, horse-power  is the worst, partly because a horse has a head of his own, partly because  he is costly, and the extent to which he is applicable in factories is  very restricted. Nevertheless the horse was extensively used during the infancy of modern industry. This is proved, as well by  the complaints of contemporary agriculturists, as by the term “horse-power,”    which has survived to this day as an expression for mechanical force.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1558,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Wind was too inconstant and uncontrollable, and besides, in England,  the birthplace of modern industry, the use of water power preponderated  even during the manufacturing period. In the 17th century attempts had already been made to turn two pairs of millstones with a single water-wheel.  But the increased size of the gearing was too much for the water power,  which had now become insufficient, and this was one of the circumstances  that led to a more accurate investigation of the laws of friction. In the  same way the irregularity caused by the motive power in mills that were  put in motion by pushing and pulling a lever, led to the theory, and the  application, of the fly-wheel, which afterwards plays so important a part  in modern industry.  that was of universal technical application, and, relatively speaking, little affected  in its choice of residence by local circumstances. The greatness of Watt’s  genius showed itself in the specification of the patent that he took out  in April, 1784. In that specification his steam-engine is described, not  as an invention for a specific purpose, but as an agent universally applicable  in Mechanical Industry. In it he points out applications, many of which,  as for instance, the steam-hammer, were not introduced till half a century  later. Nevertheless he doubted the use of steam-engines in navigation.  His successors, Boulton and Watt, sent to the exhibition of 1851 steam-engines  of colossal size for ocean steamers.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1559,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"As soon as tools had been converted from being manual implements  of man into implements of a mechanical apparatus, of a machine, the motive  mechanism also acquired an independent form, entirely emancipated from  the restraints of human strength. Thereupon the individual machine, that  we have hitherto been considering, sinks into a mere factor in production  by machinery. One motive mechanism was now able to drive many machines  at once. The motive mechanism grows with the number of the machines that  are turned simultaneously, and the transmitting mechanism becomes a wide-spreading  apparatus.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1560,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,We now proceed to distinguish the co-operation of a number of  machines of one kind from a complex system of machinery.    ,"Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1561,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"In the one case, the product is entirely made by a single machine,  which performs all the various operations previously done by one handicraftsman  with his tool; as, for instance, by a weaver with his loom; or by several  handicraftsman successively, either separately or as members of a system  of Manufacture.  For example, in the manufacture of envelopes, one man folded the paper with the folder, another laid on  the gum, a third turned the flap over, on which the device is impressed,  a fourth embossed the device, and so on; and for each of these operations  the envelope had to change hands. One single envelope machine now performs  all these operations at once, and makes more than 3,000 envelopes in an  hour. In the London exhibition of 1862, there was an American machine for  making paper cornets. It cut the paper, pasted, folded, and finished 300  in a minute. Here, the whole process, which, when carried on as Manufacture,  was split up into, and carried out by, a series of operations, is completed  by a single machine, working a combination of various tools. Now, whether  such a machine be merely a reproduction of a complicated manual implement,  or a combination of various simple implements specialised by Manufacture,  in either case, in the factory, i.e., in the workshop in which machinery  alone is used, we meet again with simple co-operation; and, leaving the  workman out of consideration for the moment, this co-operation presents  itself to us, in the first instance, as the conglomeration in one place  of similar and simultaneously acting machines. Thus, a weaving factory  is constituted of a number of power-looms, working side by side, and a  sewing factory of a number of sewing-machines all in the same building.  But there is here a technical oneness in the whole system, owing to all  the machines receiving their impulse simultaneously, and in an equal degree,  from the pulsations of the common prime mover, by the intermediary of the  transmitting mechanism; and this mechanism, to a certain extent, is also  common to them all, since only particular ramifications of it branch off  to each machine. Just as a number of tools, then, form the organs of a  machine, so a number of machines of one kind constitute the organs of the  motive mechanism.    ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1562,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"A real machinery system, however, does not take the place of these  independent machines, until the subject of labour goes through a connected  series of detail processes, that are carried out by a chain of machines  of various kinds, the one supplementing the other. Here we have again the  co-operation by division of labour that characterises Manufacture; only  now, it is a combination of detail machines. The special tools of the various  detail workmen, such as those of the beaters, cambers, spinners, &c.,  in the woollen manufacture, are now transformed into the tools of specialised  machines, each machine constituting a special organ, with a  special function, in the system. In those branches of industry in which  the machinery system is first introduced, Manufacture itself furnishes,  in a general way, the natural basis for the division, and consequent organisation,  of the process of production.  But, of course, in this case also, theory must  be perfected by accumulated experience on a large scale. Each detail machine  supplies raw material to the machine next in order; and since they are  all working at the same time, the product is always going through the various  stages of its fabrication, and is also constantly in a state of transition,  from one phase to another. Just as in Manufacture, the direct co-operation  of the detail labourers establishes a numerical proportion between the  special groups, so in an organised system of machinery, where one detail  machine is constantly kept employed by another, a fixed relation is established  between their numbers, their size, and their speed. The collective machine,  now an organised system of various kinds of single machines, and of groups  of single machines, becomes more and more perfect, the more  the process as a whole becomes a continuous one, i.e., the less the raw  material is interrupted in its passage from its first phase to its last;  in other words, the more its passage from one phase to another is effected,  not by the hand of man, but by the machinery itself. In Manufacture the  isolation of each detail process is a condition imposed by the nature of  division of labour, but in the fully developed factory the continuity of  those processes is, on the contrary, imperative.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1563,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"A system of machinery, whether it reposes on the mere co-operation  of similar machines, as in weaving, or on a combination of different machines,  as in spinning, constitutes in itself a huge automaton, whenever it is  driven by a self-acting prime mover. But although the factory as a whole  be driven by its steam-engine, yet either some of the individual machines  may require the aid of the workman for some of their movements (such aid  was necessary for the running in of the mule carriage, before the invention  of the self-acting mule, and is still necessary in fine-spinning mills);  or, to enable a machine to do its work, certain parts of it may require  to be handled by the workman like a manual tool; this was the case in machine-makers’  workshops, before the conversion of the slide rest into a self-actor. As  soon as a machine executes, without man’s help, all the movements requisite  to elaborate the raw material, needing only attendance from him, we have  an automatic system of machinery, and one that is susceptible of constant  improvement in its details. Such improvements as the apparatus that stops  a drawing frame, whenever a sliver breaks, and the self-acting stop, that  stops the power-loom so soon as the shuttle bobbin is emptied of weft,  are quite modern inventions. As an example, both of continuity of production,  and of the carrying out of the automatic principle, we may take a modern  paper mill. In the paper industry generally, we may advantageously study  in detail not only the distinctions between modes of production based on  different means of production, but also the connexion of the social conditions  of production with those modes: for the old German paper-making furnishes  us with a sample of handicraft production; that of Holland in the 17th  and of France in the 18th century with a sample of manufacturing in the  strict sense; and that of modern England with a sample of automatic fabrication  of this article. Besides these, there still exist, in India and China,  two distinct antique Asiatic forms of the same industry.  ","Machinery

1564,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"An organised system of machines, to which motion is communicated  by the transmitting mechanism from a central automaton, is the most developed  form of production by machinery. Here we have, in the place of the isolated  machine, a mechanical monster whose body fills whole factories, and whose  demon power, at first veiled under the slow and measured motions  of his giant limbs, at length breaks out into the fast and furious whirl  of his countless working organs.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1565,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"There were mules and steam-engines before there were any labourers,  whose exclusive occupation it was to make mules and steam-engines; just  as men wore clothes before there were such people as tailors. The inventions  of Vaucanson, Arkwright, Watt, and others, were, however, practicable,  only because those inventors found, ready to hand, a considerable number  of skilled mechanical workmen, placed at their disposal by the manufacturing  period. Some of these workmen were independent handicraftsman of various  trades, others were grouped together in manufactures, in which, as before-mentioned,  division of labour was strictly carried out. As inventions increased in  number, and the demand for the newly discovered machines grew larger, the  machine-making industry split up, more and more, into numerous independent  branches, and division of labour in these manufactures was more and more  developed. Here, then, we see in Manufacture the immediate technical foundation  of modern industry. Manufacture produced the machinery, by means of which  modern industry abolished the handicraft and manufacturing systems in those  spheres of production that it first seized upon. The factory system was  therefore raised, in the natural course of things, on an inadequate foundation.  When the system attained to a certain degree of development, it had to  root up this ready-made foundation, which in the meantime had been elaborated  on the old lines, and to build up for itself a basis that should correspond  to its methods of production. Just as the individual machine retains a  dwarfish character, so long as it is worked by the power of man alone,  and just as no system of machinery could be properly developed before the  steam-engine took the place of the earlier motive powers, animals, wind,  and even water; so, too, modern industry was crippled in its complete development,  so long as its characteristic instrument of production, the machine, owed  its existence to personal strength and personal skill, and depended on  the muscular development, the keenness of sight, and the cunning of hand,  with which the detail workmen in manufactures, and the manual labourers  in handicrafts, wielded their dwarfish implements. Thus, apart from the  dearness of the machines made in this way, a circumstance that is ever  present to the mind of the capitalist, the expansion of industries carried  on by means of machinery, and the invasion by machinery of fresh branches  of production, were dependent on the growth of a class of workmen, who,  owing to the almost artistic nature of their employment, could increase  their numbers only gradually, and not by leaps and bounds. But besides  this, at a certain stage of its development, modern industry became technologically  incompatible with the basis furnished for it by handicraft and Manufacture.  The increasing size of the prime movers, of the transmitting mechanism,  and of the machines proper, the greater complication, multiformity and  regularity of the details of these machines, as they more and more departed  from the model of those originally made by manual labour, and acquired  a form, untrammelled except by the conditions under which they worked,   the perfecting of the automatic system, and the  use, every day more unavoidable, of a more refractory material, such as  iron instead of wood – the solution of all these problems, which sprang up  by the force of circumstances, everywhere met with a stumbling-block in  the personal restrictions, which even the collective labourer of Manufacture  could not break through, except to a limited extent. Such machines as the  modern hydraulic press, the modern power-loom, and the modern carding engine,  could never have been furnished by Manufacture.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1566,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"A radical change in the mode of production in one sphere of industry  involves a similar change in other spheres. This happens at first in such  branches of industry as are connected together by being separate phases  of a process, and yet are isolated by the social division of labour, in  such a way, that each of them produces an independent commodity. Thus spinning  by machinery made weaving by machinery a necessity, and both together made  the mechanical and chemical revolution that took place in bleaching, printing,  and dyeing, imperative. So too, on the other hand, the revolution in cotton-spinning  called forth the invention of the gin, for separating the seeds from the  cotton fibre; it was only by means of this invention, that the production  of cotton became possible on the enormous scale at present required.  But more especially, the revolution in the modes of production of industry and agriculture made necessary a revolution in the general conditions of  the social process of production, i.e., in the means of communication and  of transport. In a society whose pivot, to use an expression of Fourier,  was agriculture on a small scale, with its subsidiary domestic  industries, and the urban handicrafts, the means of communication and transport  were so utterly inadequate to the productive requirements of the manufacturing  period, with its extended division of social labour, its concentration  of the instruments of labour, and of the workmen, and its colonial markets,  that they became in fact revolutionised. In the same way the means of communication  and transport handed down from the manufacturing period soon became unbearable  trammels on modern industry, with its feverish haste of production, its  enormous extent, its constant flinging of capital and labour from one sphere  of production into another, and its newly-created connexions with the markets  of the whole world. Hence, apart from the radical changes introduced in  the construction of sailing vessels, the means of communication and transport  became gradually adapted to the modes of production of mechanical industry,  by the creation of a system of river steamers, railways, ocean steamers,  and telegraphs. But the huge masses of iron that had now to be forged,  to be welded, to be cut, to be bored, and to be shaped, demanded, on their  part, cyclopean machines, for the construction of which the methods of  the manufacturing period were utterly inadequate.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1567,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Modern industry had therefore itself to take in hand the machine,  its characteristic instrument of production, and to construct machines  by machines. It was not till it did this, that it built up for itself a  fitting technical foundation, and stood on its own feet. Machinery, simultaneously  with the increasing use of it, in the first decades of this century, appropriated,  by degrees, the fabrication of machines proper. But it was only during  the decade preceding 1866, that the construction of railways and ocean  steamers on a stupendous scale called into existence the cyclopean machines  now employed in the construction of prime movers.    ","Machinery

1568,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The most essential condition to the production of machines by  machines was a prime mover capable of exerting any amount of force, and  yet under perfect control. Such a condition was already supplied by the  steam-engine. But at the same time it was necessary to produce the geometrically  accurate straight lines, planes, circles, cylinders, cones, and spheres,  required in the detail parts of the machines. This problem Henry Maudsley  solved in the first decade of this century by the invention of the slide  rest, a tool that was soon made automatic, and in a modified form was applied  to other constructive machines besides the lathe, for which it was originally  intended. This mechanical appliance replaces, not some particular tool,  but the hand itself, which produces a given form by holding and guiding  the cutting tool along the iron or other material operated upon. Thus it  became possible to produce the forms of the individual parts of machinery","Machinery

The  operating part of the boring machine is an immense drill driven by a steam-engine;  without this machine, on the other hand, the cylinders of large steam-engines  and of hydraulic presses could not be made. The mechanical lathe is only  a cyclopean reproduction of the ordinary foot-lathe; the planing machine,  an iron carpenter, that works on iron with the same tools that the human  carpenter employs on wood; the instrument that, on the London wharves,  cuts the veneers, is a gigantic razor; the tool of the shearing machine,  which shears iron as easily as a tailor’s scissors cut cloth, is a monster  pair of scissors; and the steam-hammer works with an ordinary hammer head,  but of such a weight that not Thor himself could wield it.

1571,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The implements of labour, in the form of machinery, necessitate  the substitution of natural forces for human force, and the conscious application  of science, instead of rule of thumb. In Manufacture, the organisation  of the social labour-process is purely subjective; it is a combination  of detail labourers; in its machinery system, modern industry has a productive  organism that is purely objective, in which the labourer becomes a mere  appendage to an already existing material condition of production. In simple  co-operation, and even in that founded on division of labour, the suppression  of the isolated, by the collective, workman still appears to be more or  less accidental. Machinery, with a few exceptions to be mentioned later,  operates only by means of associated labour, or labour in common.  Hence the co-operative character of the labour-process is, in the latter  case, a technical necessity dictated by the instrument of labour itself.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1574,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"We saw that the productive forces resulting from co-operation  and division of labour cost capital nothing. They are natural forces of  social labour. So also physical forces, like steam, water, &c., when  appropriated to productive processes, cost nothing. But just as a man requires  lungs to breathe with, so he requires something that is work of man’s hand,  in order to consume physical forces productively. A water-wheel is necessary  to exploit the force of water, and a steam-engine to exploit the elasticity  of steam. Once discovered, the law of the deviation of the magnetic needle  in the field of an electric current, or the law of the magnetisation of  iron, around which an electric current circulates, cost never a penny.   But the exploitation of these laws for the purposes of telegraphy, &c., necessitates a costly and extensive apparatus.  The tool, as we have seen, is not exterminated by the machine. From being  a dwarf implement of the human organism, it expands and multiplies into  the implement of a mechanism created by man. Capital now sets the labourer  to work, not with a manual tool, but with a machine which itself handles  the tools. Although, therefore, it is clear at the first glance that, by  incorporating both stupendous physical forces, and the natural sciences,  with the process of production, modern industry raises the productiveness  of labour to an extraordinary degree, it is by no means equally clear,  that this increased productive force is not, on the other hand, purchased  by an increased expenditure of labour. Machinery, like every other component  of constant capital, creates no new value, but yields up its own value  to the product that it serves to beget. In so far as the machine has value,  and, in consequence, parts with value to the product, it forms an element  in the value of that product. Instead of being cheapened, the product is  made dearer in proportion to the value of the machine. And it is clear  as noon-day, that machines and systems of machinery, the characteristic  instruments of labour of Modern Industry, are incomparably more  loaded with value than the implements used in handicrafts and manufactures.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1575,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"In the first place, it must be observed that the machinery, while  always entering as a whole into the labour-process, enters into the value-begetting  process only by bits. It never adds more value than it loses, on an average,  by wear and tear. Hence there is a great difference between the value of  a machine, and the value transferred in a given time by that machine to  the product. The longer the life of the machine in the labour-process,  the greater is that difference. It is true, no doubt, as we have already  seen, that every instrument of labour enters as a whole into the labour-process,  and only piece-meal, proportionally to its average daily loss by wear and  tear, into the value-begetting process. But this difference between the  instrument as a whole and its daily wear and tear, is much greater in a  machine than in a tool, because the machine, being made from more durable  material, has a longer life; because its employment, being regulated by  strictly scientific laws, allows of greater economy in the wear and tear  of its parts, and in the materials it consumes; and lastly, because its  field of production is incomparably larger than that of a tool. After making  allowance, both in the case of the machine and of the tool, for their average  daily cost, that is for the value they transmit to the product by their  average daily wear and tear, and for their consumption of auxiliary substance,  such as oil, coal, and so on, they each do their work gratuitously, just  like the forces furnished by Nature without the help of man. The greater  the productive power of the machinery compared with that of the tool, the  greater is the extent of its gratuitous service compared with that of the  tool. In modern industry man succeeded for the first time in making the  product of his past labour work on a large scale gratuitously, like the  forces of Nature.  ","Machinery

The same is the case with the  steam-hammer mentioned above. Since its daily wear and tear, its coal-consumption,  &c., are spread over the stupendous masses of iron hammered by it in  a day, only a small value is added to a hundred weight of iron; but that  value would be very great, if the cyclopean instrument were employed in  driving in nails.

I return  to this example in order to clear up an erroneous notion. The 15 shillings  are by no means the expression in money of all the labour expended in one  hour by the 66 men. If the ratio of surplus-labour to necessary labour  were 100%, these 66 men would produce in one hour a value of 30 shillings,  although their wages, 15 shillings, represent only their labour for half  an hour. Suppose, then, a machine cost as much as the wages for a year  of the 150 men it displaces, say £3,000; this £3,000 is by  no means the expression in money of the labour added to the object produced  by these 150 men before the introduction of the machine, but only of that  portion of their year’s labour which was expended for themselves and represented  by their wages. On the other hand, the £3,000, the money-value of  the machine, expresses all the labour expended on its production, no matter  in what proportion this labour constitutes wages for the workman, and surplus-value  for the capitalist. Therefore, though a machine cost as much as the labour-power  displaced by it costs, yet the labour materialised in it is even then much  less than the living labour it replaces.  ","Machinery

Instead of paying  for the labour, he only pays the value of the labour-power employed; therefore,  the limit to his using a machine is fixed by the difference between the  value of the machine and the value of the labour-power replaced by it.  Since the division of the day’s work into necessary and surplus-labour  differs in different countries, and even in the same country at different  periods, or in different branches of industry; and further, since the actual  wage of the labourer at one time sinks below the value of his labour-power,  at another rises above it, it is possible for the difference between the  price of the machinery and the price of the labour-power replaced  by that machinery to vary very much, although the difference between the  quantity of labour requisite to produce the machine and the total quantity  replaced by it, remain constant.  because the labour required to produce horses and machines is an accurately known quantity, while that required  to maintain the women of the surplus-population is below all calculation.

The  labour of women and children was, therefore, the first thing sought for  by capitalists who used machinery. That mighty substitute for labour and  labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number  of wage-labourers by enrolling, under the direct sway of capital, every  member of the workman’s family, without distinction of age or sex. Compulsory  work for the capitalist usurped the place, not only of the children’s play,  but also of free labour at home within moderate limits for the support  of the family.  ","Machinery

Machinery, by throwing every  member of that family on to the labour-market, spreads the value of the  man’s labour-power over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labour-power.  To purchase the labour-power of a family of four workers may, perhaps,  cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labour-power of the head  of the family, but, in return, four days’ labour takes the place of one,  and their price falls in proportion to the excess of the surplus-labour  of four over the surplus-labour of one. In order that the family may live,  four people must now, not only labour, but expend surplus-labour for the  capitalist.

But now the capitalist buys children and young persons under  age. Previously, the workman sold his own labour-power, which he disposed  of nominally as a free agent. Now he sells wife and child.

A surgeon officially appointed must certify  their age. The manufacturer, therefore, asks for children who look as if  they were already 13 years old. The decrease, often by leaps and bounds  in the number of children under 13 years employed in factories, a decrease  that is shown in an astonishing manner by the English statistics of the  last 20 years, was for the most part, according to the evidence of the  factory inspectors themselves, the work of the certifying surgeons, who  overstated the age of the children, agreeably to the capitalist’s greed  for exploitation, and the sordid trafficking needs of the parents. In the  notorious district of Bethnal Green, a public market is held every Monday  and Tuesday morning, where children of both sexes from 9 years of age upwards,  hire themselves out to the silk manufacturers. ""The usual terms are 1s. 8d. a week (this belongs to the parents) and ‘2d. for myself and tea.’ The contract is binding only for the week. The scene and language while  this market is going on are quite disgraceful.”  The revolution effected by machinery in the juridical relations between the buyer and the seller of labour-power, causing the transaction as a  whole to lose the appearance of a contract between free persons,  afforded the English Parliament an excuse, founded on juridical principles,  for the interference of the state with factories. Whenever the law limits  the labour of children to 6 hours in industries not before interfered with,  the complaints of the manufacturers are always renewed. They allege that  numbers of the parents withdraw their children from the industry brought  under the Act, in order to sell them where “freedom of labour” still rules,  i.e., where children under 13 years are compelled to work like grown-up  people, and therefore can be got rid of at a higher price. But since capital  is by nature a leveller, since it exacts in every sphere of production  equality in the conditions of the exploitation of labour, the limitation  by law of children’s labour, in one branch of industry, becomes the cause  of its limitation in others.

1619,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Machinery produces relative surplus-value; not only by directly  depreciating the value of labour-power, and by indirectly cheapening the  same through cheapening the commodities that enter into its reproduction,  but also, when it is first introduced sporadically into an industry, by  converting the labour employed by the owner of that machinery, into labour  of a higher degree and greater efficacy, by raising the social value of  the article produced above its individual value, and thus enabling the  capitalist to replace the value of a day’s labour-power by a smaller portion  of the value of a day’s product. During this transition period, when the  use of machinery is a sort of monopoly, the profits are therefore exceptional,  and the capitalist endeavours to exploit thoroughly “the sunny time of  this his first love,” by prolonging the working-day as much as possible.  The magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit.  ","Machinery

1620,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"As the use of machinery becomes more general in a particular industry,  the social value of the product sinks down to its individual value, and  the law that surplus-value does not arise from the labour-power that has  been replaced by the machinery, but from the labour-power actually employed  in working with the machinery, asserts itself. Surplus-value arises from  variable capital alone, and we saw that the amount of surplus-value depends  on two factors, viz., the rate of surplus-value and the number of the workmen  simultaneously employed. Given the length of the working-day, the rate  of surplus-value is determined by the relative duration of the necessary  labour and of the surplus-labour in a day. The number of the labourers  simultaneously employed depends, on its side, on the ratio of the variable  to the constant capital. Now, however much the use of machinery may increase  the surplus-labour at the expense of the necessary labour by heightening  the productiveness of labour, it is clear that it attains this result,  only by diminishing the number of workmen employed by a given amount of  capital. It converts what was formerly variable capital, invested in labour-power,  into machinery which, being constant capital, does not produce surplus-value.  It is impossible, for instance, to squeeze as much surplus-value out of  2 as out of 24 labourers. If each of these 24 men gives only one hour of  surplus-labour in 12, the 24 men give together 24 hours of surplus-labour,  while 24 hours is the total labour of the two men. Hence, the application  of machinery to the production of surplus-value implies a contradiction  which is immanent in it, since of the two factors of the surplus-value  created by a given amount of capital, one, the rate of surplus-value, cannot  be increased, except by diminishing the other, the number of workmen. This  contradiction comes to light, as soon as by the general employment of machinery  in a given industry, the value of the machine-produced commodity regulates  the value of all commodities of the same sort; and it is this contradiction,  that in its turn, drives the capitalist, without his being conscious of  the fact,  to excessive lengthening of the working-day, in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of  labourers exploited, by an increase not only of the relative, but of the  absolute surplus-labour.

1621,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"If, then, the capitalistic employment of machinery, on the one  hand, supplies new and powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of  the working-day, and radically changes, as well the methods of labour,  as also the character of the social working organism, in such a manner  as to break down all opposition to this tendency, on the other hand it  produces, partly by opening out to the capitalist new strata of the working-class,  previously inaccessible to him, partly by setting free the labourers it  supplants, a surplus working population,  Oh! those heathens! They understood, as the learned Bastiat, and before him the still wiser  MacCulloch have discovered, nothing of Political Economy and Christianity.  They did not, for example, comprehend that machinery is the surest means  of lengthening the working-day. They perhaps excused the slavery of one  on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another. But  to preach slavery of the masses, in order that a few crude and half-educated  parvenus, might become “eminent spinners,” “extensive sausage-makers,”    and “influential shoe-black dealers,” to do this, they lacked the bump  of Christianity.

Thenceforth a phenomenon that we have already  met with, namely, the intensification of labour, develops into great importance.  Our analysis of absolute surplus-value had reference primarily to the extension  or duration of the labour, its intensity being assumed as given. We now  proceed to consider the substitution of a more intensified labour for labour  of more extensive duration, and the degree of the former.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1623,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"It is self-evident, that in proportion as the use of machinery  spreads, and the experience of a special class of workmen habituated to  machinery accumulates, the rapidity and intensity of labour increase as  a natural consequence. Thus in England, during half a century, lengthening  of the working-day went hand in hand with increasing intensity of factory  labour. Nevertheless the reader will clearly see, that where we have labour,  not carried on by fits and starts, but repeated day after day with unvarying  uniformity, a point must inevitably be reached, where extension of the  working-day and intensity of the labour mutually exclude one another, in  such a way that lengthening of the working-day becomes compatible only  with a lower degree of intensity, and a higher degree of intensity, only  with a shortening of the working-day. So soon as the gradually surging  revolt of the working-class compelled Parliament to shorten compulsorily  the hours of labour, and to begin by imposing a normal working-day on factories  proper, so soon consequently as an increased production of surplus-value  by the prolongation of the working-day was once for all put a stop to,  from that moment capital threw itself with all its might into the production  of relative surplus-value, by hastening on the further improvement of machinery.  At the same time a change took place in the nature of relative surplus-value.  Generally speaking, the mode of producing relative surplus-value consists  in raising the productive power of the workman, so as to enable him to  produce more in a given time with the same expenditure of labour. Labour-time  continues to transmit as before the same value to the total product, but  this unchanged amount of exchange-value is spread over more use-value;  hence the value of each single commodity sinks. Otherwise, however, so  soon as the compulsory shortening of the hours of labour takes place. The  immense impetus it gives the development of productive power, and to economy  in the means of production, imposes on the workman increased expenditure  of labour in a given time, heightened tension of labour-power, and closer  filling up of the pores of the working-day, or condensation of labour to  a degree that is attainable only within the limits of the shortened working-day.  This condensation of a greater mass of labour into a given period thenceforward  counts for what it really is, a greater quantity of labour. In addition  to a measure of its extension, i.e., duration, labour now acquires a measure  of its intensity or of the degree of its condensation or density.  The denser hour of the ten hours’ working-day contains more labour, i.e., expended labour-power than the more porous hour of the twelve hours’ working-day. The product therefore of one of the former hours has as much or more value  than has the product of 1 1/5 of the latter hours. Apart from the increased  yield of relative surplus-value through the heightened productiveness of  labour, the same mass of value is now produced for the capitalist say by  3 1/3 hours of surplus-labour, and 6 2/3 hours of necessary labour, as  was previously produced by four hours of surplus-labour and eight hours  of necessary labour.

1625,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The first effect of shortening the working-day results from the  self-evident law, that the efficiency of labour-power is in an inverse  ratio to the duration of its expenditure. Hence, within certain limits  what is lost by shortening the duration is gained by the increasing tension  of labour-power. That the workman moreover really does expend more labour-power,  is ensured by the mode in which the capitalist pays him.  It seemed, however, doubtful whether this effect was produced in the factory proper, where the dependence of the workman  on the continuous and uniform motion of the machinery had already created  the strictest discipline. Hence, when in 1844 the reduction of the working-day  to less than twelve hours was being debated, the masters almost unanimously  declared","Machinery

and Modern Industry"
1627,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"This assertion was contradicted by experiments.   Mr. Robert Gardner reduced the hours of labour in his two large factories at Preston, on and after  the 20th April, 1844, from twelve to eleven hours a day. The result of  about a year’s working was that “the same amount of product for the same  cost was received, and the workpeople as a whole earned in eleven  hours as much wages as they did before in twelve.”  ","Machinery

1628,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The shortening of the hours of labour creates, to begin with,  the subjective conditions for the condensation of labour, by enabling the  workman to exert more strength in a given time. So soon as that shortening  becomes compulsory, machinery becomes in the hands of capital the objective  means, systematically employed for squeezing out more labour in a given  time. This is effected in two ways: by increasing the speed of the machinery,  and by giving the workman more machinery to tent. Improved construction  of the machinery is necessary, partly because without it greater pressure  cannot be put on the workman, and partly because the shortened hours of  labour force the capitalist to exercise the strictest watch over the cost  of production. The improvements in the steam-engine have increased the  piston speed, and at the same time have made it possible, by means of a  greater economy of power, to drive with the same or even a smaller consumption  of coal more machinery with the same engine. The improvements in the transmitting  mechanism have lessened friction, and, what so strikingly distinguishes  modern from the older machinery, have reduced the diameter and weight of  the shafting to a constantly decreasing minimum. Finally, the  improvements in the operative machines have, while reducing their size,  increased their speed and efficiency, as in the modern power-loom; or,  while increasing the size of their framework, have also increased the extent  and number of their working parts, as in spinning-mules, or have added  to the speed of these working parts by imperceptible alterations of detail,  such as those which ten years ago increased the speed of the spindles in  self-acting mules by one-fifth.

Machinery  has executed, no doubt, the work that would demand the sinews of millions  of men; but it has also prodigiously multiplied the labour of those who  are governed by its fearful movements.... In 1815, the labour of following  a pair of mules spinning cotton of No. 40 — reckoning 12 hours to the  working-day — involved a necessity of walking 8 miles. In 1832, the distance  travelled in following a pair of mules, spinning cotton yarn of the same  number, was 20 miles, and frequently more. In 1835” (query — 1815 or 1825?)   “the spinner put up daily, on each of these mules, 820 stretches, making  a total of 1,640 stretches in the course of the day. In 1832, the spinner  put up on each mule 2,200 stretches, making a total of 4,400. In 1844,  2,400 stretches, making a total of 4,800; and in some cases the amount  of labour required is even still greater.... I have another document sent  to me in 1842, stating that the labour is progressively increasing – increasing  not only because the distance to be travelled is greater, but because the  quantity of goods produced is multiplied, while the hands are fewer in  proportion than before; and, moreover, because an inferior species of cotton  is now often spun, which it is more difficult to work.... In the carding-room  there has also been a great increase of labour. One person there does the  work formerly divided between two. In the weaving-room, where a vast number  of persons are employed, and principally females ... the labour has increased  within the last few years fully 10 per cent., owing to the increased speed  of the machinery in spinning. In 1838, the number of hanks spun per week  was 18,000, in 1843 it amounted to 21,000. In 1819, the number  of picks in power-loom-weaving per minute was 60 — in 1842 it was 140,  showing a vast increase of labour.”  ","Machinery

1634,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm," “Now, as the quantity produced must, in the main, be regulated  by the speed of the machinery, it must be the interest of the mill-owner  to drive it at the utmost rate of speed consistent with these following  conditions, viz., the preservation of the machinery from too rapid deterioration;  the preservation of the quality of the article manufactured; and the capability  of the workman to follow the motion without a greater exertion than he  can sustain for a constancy. One of the most important problems, therefore,  which the owner of a factory has to solve is to find out the maximum speed  at which he can run, with a due regard to the above conditions. It frequently  happens that he finds he has gone too fast, that breakages and bad work  more than counterbalance the increased speed, and that he is obliged to slacken his pace. I therefore concluded, that as an active and intelligent  mill-owner would find out the safe maximum, it would not be possible to  produce as much in eleven hours as in twelve. I further assumed that the  operative paid by piecework, would exert himself to the utmost consistent  with the power of continuing at the same rate.” ","Machinery

But the  employment of machinery does away with the necessity of crystallising this  distribution after the manner of Manufacture, by the constant annexation  of a particular man to a particular function.  and owing to its extreme simplicity, it allows of a rapid and constant change of the individuals burdened with this drudgery.

The life-long speciality of handling  one and the same tool, now becomes the life-long speciality of serving  one and the same machine. Machinery is put to a wrong use, with the object  of transforming the workman, from his very childhood, into a part of a  detail-machine.  In this way, not only are the  expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened, but at the same time  his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole, and therefore upon  the capitalist, is rendered complete. Here as everywhere else, we must  distinguish between the increased productiveness due to the development  of the social process of production, and that due to the capitalist exploitation  of that process. In handicrafts and manufacture, the workman makes use  of a tool, in the factory, the machine makes use of him. There the movements  of the instrument of labour proceed from him, here it is the movements  of the machine that he must follow. In manufacture the workmen are parts  of a living mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent  of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage.","Machinery

The lightening of the  labour, even, becomes a sort of torture, since the machine does not free  the labourer from work, but deprives the work of all interest. Every kind  of capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a labour-process,  but also a process of creating surplus-value, has this in common, that  it is not the workman that employs the instruments of labour, but the  instruments of labour that employ the workman. But it is only in the factory  system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable  reality. By means of its conversion into an automaton, the instrument of  labour confronts the labourer, during the labour-process, in the shape  of capital, of dead labour, that dominates, and pumps dry, living labour-power.  The separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual  labour, and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over  labour, is, as we have already shown, finally completed by modern industry  erected on the foundation of machinery. The special skill of each individual  insignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before  the science, the gigantic physical forces, and the mass of labour that  are embodied in the factory mechanism and, together with that mechanism,  constitute the power of the “master.” This “master,” therefore, in whose  brain the machinery and his monopoly of it are inseparably united, whenever  he falls out with his “hands,” contemptuously tells them:","Machinery

The opposition against  the establishment of new manufactures, proceeds from the guilds and privileged  towns, not from the workpeople. Hence the writers of the manufacturing  period treat the division of labour chiefly as a means of virtually supplying  a deficiency of labourers, and not as a means of actually displacing those  in work. This distinction is self-evident. If it be said that 100 millions  of people would be required in England to spin with the old spinning-wheel  the cotton that is now spun with mules by 500,000 people, this does not  mean that the mules took the place of those millions who never existed.  It means only this, that many millions of workpeople would be required  to replace the spinning machinery. If, on the other hand, we say, that  in England the power-loom threw 800,000 weavers on the streets, we do not  refer to existing machinery, that would have to be replaced by a definite  number of workpeople, but to a number of weavers in existence who were  actually replaced or displaced by the looms. During the manufacturing period,  handicraft labour, altered though it was by division of labour, was yet  the basis. The demands of the new colonial markets could not be satisfied  owing to the relatively small number of town operatives handed  down from the middle ages, and the manufactures proper opened out new fields  of production to the rural population, driven from the land by the dissolution  of the feudal system. At that time, therefore, division of labour and co-operation  in the workshops, were viewed more from the positive aspect, that they  made the workpeople more productive.

To  simplify matters, we take no account of buildings, coal, &c. Further  suppose that the raw material annually consumed costs £3,000, both  before and after the change.  Is any capital set free by this metamorphosis? Before the change, the total sum of £6,000  consisted half of constant, and half of variable capital.

The variable capital, instead  of being one half, is only one quarter, of the total capital. Instead of  being set free, a part of the capital is here locked up in such a way as  to cease to be exchanged against labour-power: variable has been changed  into constant capital.

If the newly introduced machinery  had cost less than did the labour-power and implements displaced by it,  if, for instance, instead of costing £1,500, it had cost only £1,000,  a variable capital of £1,000 would have been converted into constant  capital, and locked up; and a capital of £500 would have been set  free. The latter sum, supposing wages unchanged, would form a fund sufficient  to employ about 16 out of the 50 men discharged; nay, less than 16, for,  in order to be employed as capital, a part of this £500 must now  become constant capital, thus leaving only the remainder to be laid out  in labour-power.

The simple fact, by no means  a new one, that machinery cuts off the workmen from their means of subsistence  is, therefore, in economic parlance tantamount to this, that machinery  liberates means of subsistence for the workman, or converts those means  into capital for his employment.

What really confronted them  as capital, was the sum of £1,500, afterwards laid out in machinery.  On looking closer it will be seen that this sum represented part of the  carpets produced in a year by the 50 discharged men, which part they received  as wages from their employer in money instead of in kind. With the carpets  in the form of money, they bought means of subsistence to the value of  £1,500. These means, therefore, were to them, not capital, but commodities,  and they, as regards these commodities, were not wage-labourers, but buyers.  The circumstance that they were “freed” by the machinery, from the means  of purchase, changed them from buyers into non-buyers. Hence a lessened  demand for those commodities — voilà tout. If this diminution be  not compensated by an increase from some other quarter, the market price  of the commodities falls. If this state of things lasts for some time,  and extends, there follows a discharge of workmen employed in the production  of these commodities. Some of the capital that was previously devoted to  production of necessary means of subsistence, has to become reproduced  in another form. While prices fall, and capital is being displaced, the  labourers employed in the production of necessary means of subsistence  are in their turn “freed” from a part of their wages. Instead, therefore,  of proving that, when machinery frees the workman from his means of subsistence,  it simultaneously converts those means into capital for his further employment,  our apologists, with their cut-and-dried law of supply and demand, prove,  on the contrary, that machinery throws workmen on the streets, not  only in that branch of production in which it is introduced, but also in  those branches in which it is not introduced.

In Part VII of this book it will be  seen that this effect of machinery, which, as we have seen, is represented  to be a compensation to the working class, is on the contrary a most frightful  scourge. For the present I will only say this: The labourers that are thrown  out of work in any branch of industry, can no doubt seek for employment  in some other branch. If they find it, and thus renew the bond between  them and the means of subsistence, this takes place only by the intermediary  of a new and additional capital that is seeking investment; not at all  by the intermediary of the capital that formerly employed them and was  afterwards converted into machinery. And even should they find employment,  what a poor look-out is theirs! Crippled as they are by division of labour,  these poor devils are worth so little outside their old trade, that they  cannot find admission into any industries, except a few of inferior kind,  that are over-supplied with underpaid workmen.  Further, every branch of industry attracts each year a new stream of men, who furnish a contingent from which to fill up vacancies, and to draw a  supply for expansion. So soon as machinery sets free a part of the workmen  employed in a given branch of industry, the reserve men are also diverted  into new channels of employment, and become absorbed in other branches;  meanwhile the original victims, during the period of transition, for the  most part starve and perish.  ","Machinery

1710,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"It is an undoubted fact that machinery, as such, is not responsible  for “setting free” the workman from the means of subsistence. It cheapens  and increases production in that branch which it seizes on, and at first  makes no change in the mass of the means of subsistence produced in other  branches. Hence, after its introduction, the society possesses as much,  if not more, of the necessaries of life than before, for the labourers  thrown out of work; and that quite apart from the enormous share of the  annual produce wasted by the non-workers. And this is the point relied  on by our apologists! The contradictions and antagonisms inseparable from  the capitalist employment of machinery, do not exist, they say, since they  do not arise out of machinery, as such, but out of its capitalist employment!  Since therefore machinery, considered alone, shortens the hours of labour,  but, when in the service of capital, lengthens them; since in itself it  lightens labour, but when employed by capital, heightens the intensity  of labour; since in itself it is a victory of man over the forces of Nature,  but in the hands of capital, makes man the slave of those forces; since  in itself it increases the wealth of the producers, but in the hands of  capital, makes them paupers – for all these reasons and others besides, says  the bourgeois economist without more ado, it is clear as noon-day that  all these contradictions are a mere semblance of the reality, and that,  as a matter of fact, they have neither an actual nor a theoretical existence.  Thus he saves himself from all further puzzling of the brain, and what  is more, implicitly declares his opponent to be stupid enough to contend  against, not the capitalistic employment of machinery, but machinery itself.

1711,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"No doubt he is far from denying that temporary inconvenience may  result from the capitalist use of machinery. But where is the medal without  its reverse! Any employment of machinery, except by capital, is to him  an impossibility. Exploitation of the workman by the machine is therefore,  with him, identical with exploitation of the machine by the workman. Whoever,  therefore, exposes the real state of things in the capitalistic employment  of machinery, is against its employment in any way, and is an enemy of  social progress!  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1712,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Although machinery necessarily throws men out of work in  those industries into which it is introduced, yet it may, notwithstanding  this, bring about an increase of employment in other industries. This effect,  however, has nothing in common with the so-called theory of compensation.  Since every article produced by a machine is cheaper than a similar article  produced by hand, we deduce the following infallible law: If the total  quantity of the article produced by machinery, be equal to the total quantity  of the article previously produced by a handicraft or by manufacture, and  now made by machinery, then the total labour expended is diminished. The  new labour spent on the instruments of labour, on the machinery, on the  coal, and so on, must necessarily be less than the labour displaced by  the use of the machinery; otherwise the product of the machine would be  as dear, or dearer, than the product of the manual labour. But, as a matter  of fact, the total quantity of the article produced by machinery with a  diminished number of workmen, instead of remaining equal to, by far exceeds  the total quantity of the hand-made article that has been displaced. Suppose  that 400,000 yards of cloth have been produced on power-looms by fewer  weavers than could weave 100,000 yards by hand. In the quadrupled product  there lies four times as much raw material. Hence the production of raw  material must be quadrupled. But as regards the instruments of labour,  such as buildings, coal, machinery, and so on, it is different; the limit  up to which the additional labour required for their production can increase,  varies with the difference between the quantity of the machine-made article,  and the quantity of the same article that the same number of workmen could  make by hand.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1713,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Hence, as the use of machinery extends in a given industry, the  immediate effect is to increase production in the other industries that  furnish the first with means of production. How far employment is thereby found for an increased number of men, depends, given the length of the working-day and the intensity of labour, on the composition of the capital employed, i.e., on the ratio of its constant to its variable component.  This ratio, in its turn, varies considerably with the extent to which machinery  has already seized on, or is then seizing on, those trades. The number  of the men condemned to work in coal and metal mines increased enormously  owing to the progress of the English factory system; but during the last  few decades this increase of number has been less rapid, owing to the use  of new machinery in mining.  there is not the least doubt that the rapid strides of cotton spinning, not only pushed on with tropical luxuriance the growth of cotton in the United States, and with it the African slave trade, but also made the breeding of slaves the chief business of  the border slave-states. When, in 1790, the first census of slaves was  taken in the United States, their number was 697,000; in 1861 it had nearly  reached four millions. On the other hand, it is no less certain that the  rise of the English woollen factories, together with the gradual conversion  of arable land into sheep pasture, brought, about the superfluity of agricultural  labourers that led to their being driven in masses into the towns. Ireland,  having during the last twenty years reduced its population by nearly one  half, is at this moment undergoing the process of still further reducing  the number of its inhabitants, so as exactly to suit the requirements of  its landlords and of the English woollen manufacturers.

1714,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"When machinery is applied to any of the preliminary or intermediate  stages through which the subject of labour has to pass on its way to completion,  there is an increased yield of material in those stages, and simultaneously  an increased demand for labour in the handicrafts or manufactures supplied  by the produce of the machines. Spinning by machinery, for example, supplied  yarn so cheaply and so abundantly that the hand-loom weavers were, at first,  able to work full time without increased outlay. Their earnings accordingly  rose.  Hence a flow of people into the cotton-weaving trade, till at length the 800,000 weavers, called into existence by the  Jenny, the throstle and the mule, were overwhelmed by the power-loom. So  also, owing to the abundance of clothing materials produced by machinery,  the number of tailors, seamstresses and needlewomen, went on increasing  until the appearance of the sewing-machine.

The factory system carries the social  division of labour immeasurably further than does manufacture, for it increases  the productiveness of the industries it seizes upon, in a far higher degree.

1716,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The immediate result of machinery is to augment surplus-value  and the mass of products in which surplus-value is embodied. And, as the  substances consumed by the capitalists and their dependents become more  plentiful, so too do these orders of society. Their growing wealth, and  the relatively diminished number of workmen required to produce the necessaries  of life beget, simultaneously with the rise of new and luxurious wants,  the means of satisfying those wants. A larger portion of the produce of  society is changed into surplus-produce, and a larger part of the surplus-produce  is supplied for consumption in a multiplicity of refined shapes. In other  words, the production of luxuries increases.  ","Machinery

1717,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The increase of the means of production and subsistence, accompanied  by a relative diminution in the number of labourers, causes an increased  demand for labour in making canals, docks, tunnels, bridges, and so on,  works that can only bear fruit in the far future. Entirely new branches  of production, creating new fields of labour, are also formed, as the direct  result either of machinery or of the general industrial changes brought  about by it. But the place occupied by these branches in the general production  is, even in the most developed countries, far from important. The number  of labourers that find employment in them is directly proportional to the  demand, created by those industries, for the crudest form of manual labour.  The chief industries of this kind are, at present, gas-works, telegraphs,  photography, steam navigation, and railways. According to the census of  1861 for England and Wales, we find in the gas industry (gas-works,  production of mechanical apparatus, servants of the gas companies, &c),  15,211 persons; in telegraphy, 2,399; in photography, 2,366; steam navigation,  3,570; and in railways, 70,599, of whom the unskilled “navvies,” more or  less permanently employed, and the whole administrative and commercial  staff, make up about 28,000.

According to the census of 1861, the population of England and  Wales was 20,066,244; of these, 9,776,259 males, and 10,289,965 females.  If we deduct from this population all who are too old or too young for  work, all unproductive women, young persons and children, the “ideological”    classes, such as government officials, priests, lawyers, soldiers, &c.;  further, all who have no occupation but to consume the labour of others  in the form of rent, interest, &c.; and, lastly, paupers, vagabonds,  and criminals, there remain in round numbers eight millions of the two  sexes of every age, including in that number every capitalist who is in  any way engaged in industry, commerce, or finance.

In the year 1860, when a special census of all the factories  in the United Kingdom was taken by order of Parliament, the factories in  those parts of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire, included in the district  of Mr. Baker, the factory inspector, numbered 652; 570 of these contained  85,622 power-looms, 6,819,146 spindles (exclusive of doubling spindles),  employed 27,439 horse-power (steam), and 1,390 (water), and 94,119 persons. In the year 1865, the same factories contained, looms 95,163, spindles  7,025,031, had a steam-power of 28,925 horses, and a water-power of 1,445  horses, and employed 88,913 persons. Between 1860 and 1865, therefore,  the increase in looms was 11%, in spindles 3%, and in engine-power 3%,  while the number of persons employed decreased 5½%.  Between 1852 and 1862, considerable extension of the English woollen manufacture took place, while the number of hands employed in it remained almost stationary, ","Machinery

1725,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"In certain cases, the increase in the number of hands employed is only apparent; that is,  it is not due to the extension of the factories already established, but  to the gradual annexation of connected trades; for instance, the increase  in power-looms, and in the hands employed by them between 1838 and 1856,  was, in the cotton trade, simply owing to the extension of this branch  of industry; but in the other trades to the application of steam-power  to the carpet-loom, to the ribbon-loom, and to the linen-loom, which previously  had been worked by the power of men.  Hence the increase of the hands in these latter trades was merely a symptom of a  diminution in the total number employed. Finally, we have considered this  question entirely apart from the fact, that everywhere, except in the metal  industries, young persons (under 18), and women and children form the preponderating  element in the class of factory hands.  ","Machinery
and Modern Industry"
1726,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Nevertheless, in spite of the mass of hands actually displaced  and virtually replaced by machinery, we can understand how the  factory operatives, through the building of more mills and the extension  of old ones in a given industry, may become more numerous than the manufacturing  workmen and handicraftsman that have been displaced. Suppose, for example,  that in the old mode of production, a capital of £500 is employed  weekly, two-fifths being constant and three-fifths variable capital, i.e.,  £200 being laid out in means of production, and £300, say £1  per man, in labour-power. On the introduction of machinery the composition  of this capital becomes altered. We will suppose it to consist of four-fifths  constant and one-fifth variable, which means that only £100 is now  laid out in labour-power. Consequently, two-thirds of the workmen are discharged.  If now the business extends, and the total capital employed grows to £1,500  under unchanged conditions, the number of operatives employed will increase  to 300, just as many as before the introduction of the machinery. If the  capital further grows to £2,000, 400 men will be employed, or one-third  more than under the old system. Their numbers have, in point of fact, increased  by 100, but relatively, i.e., in proportion to the total capital advanced,  they have diminished by 800, for the £2,000 capital would, in the  old state of things, have employed 1,200 instead of 400 men. Hence, a relative  decrease in the number of hands is consistent with an actual increase.  We assumed above that while the total capital increases, its composition  remains the same, because the conditions of production remain constant.  But we have already seen that, with every advance in the use of machinery,  the constant component of capital, that part which consists of machinery,  raw material, &c., increases, while the variable component, the part  laid out in labour-power, decreases. We also know that in no other system  of production is improvement so continuous, and the composition of the  capital employed so constantly changing as in the factory system. These  changes are, however, continually interrupted by periods of rest, during  which there is a mere quantitative extension of the factories on the existing  technical basis. During such periods the operatives increase in number.  Thus, in 1835, the total number of operatives in the cotton, woollen, worsted,  flax, and silk factories of the United Kingdom was only 354,684; while  in 1861 the number of the power-loom weavers alone (of both sexes and of  all ages, from eight years upwards), amounted to 230,654. Certainly, this  growth appears less important when we consider that in 1838 the hand-loom  weavers with their families still numbered 800,000,  not to mention those thrown out of work in Asia, and on the Continent of Europe.

This  first period, during which machinery conquers its field of action, is of  decisive importance owing to the extraordinary profits that it helps to  produce. These profits not only form a source of accelerated accumulation,  but also attract into the favoured sphere of production a large part of  the additional social capital that is being constantly created, and is  ever on the look-out for new investments. The special advantages of this  first period of fast and furious activity are felt in every branch of production  that machinery invades. So soon, however, as the factory system has gained  a certain breadth of footing and a definite degree of maturity, and, especially,  so soon as its technical basis, machinery, is itself produced by machinery;  so soon as coal mining and iron mining, the metal industries, and the means  of transport have been revolutionised; so soon, in short, as the general  conditions requisite for production by the modern industrial system have  been established, this mode of production acquires an elasticity,  a capacity for sudden extension by leaps and bounds that finds no hindrance except in the supply of raw material and in the disposal of the produce. On the  one hand, the immediate effect of machinery is to increase the supply of  raw material in the same way, for example, as the cotton gin augmented  the production of cotton.  ","Machinery

The uncertainty and  instability to which machinery subjects the employment, and consequently  the conditions of existence, of the operatives become normal, owing to  these periodic changes of the industrial cycle. Except in the periods of  prosperity, there rages between the capitalists the most furious combat  for the share of each in the markets. This share is directly proportional  to the cheapness of the product. Besides the rivalry that this struggle  begets in the application of improved machinery for replacing labour-power,  and of new methods of production, there also comes a time in every industrial  cycle, when a forcible reduction of wages beneath the value of labour-power,  is attempted for the purpose of cheapening commodities.

The fibre being so short, a great amount  of size, both animal and vegetable, is used.... Bronchitis is more prevalent  owing to the dust. Inflammatory sore throat is common, from the same cause.  Sickness and dyspepsia are produced by the frequent breaking of the weft,  when the weaver sucks the weft through the eye of the shuttle.” On the other hand, the substitutes for flour were a Fortunatus’ purse to the manufacturers, by increasing the weight of the yarn. They caused “15 lbs. of raw material  to weigh 26 lbs. after it was woven.” ","Machinery

These  were ordinary export shirtings. In cloths of other descriptions, as much  as 50 per cent. size is sometimes added; so that a manufacturer may, and  does truly boast, that he is getting rich by selling cloth for less money  per pound than he paid for the mere yarn of which they are composed.” ","Machinery

The second period from 1815 to 1863 counts, during  its 48 years, only 20 years of revival and prosperity against 28 of depression  and stagnation. Between 1815 and 1830 the competition with the continent  of Europe and with the United States sets in. After 1833, the extension  of the Asiatic markets is enforced by “destruction of the human race” (the  wholesale extinction of Indian hand-loom weavers). After the repeal of  the Corn Laws, from 1846 to 1863, there are 8 years of moderate activity  and prosperity against 9 years of depression and stagnation.

An example of the first sort is the mowing-machine; it replaces  co-operation between mowers. A striking example of the second kind, is  the needle-making machine. According to Adam Smith, 10 men, in his day,  made in co-operation, over 48,000 needles a-day. On the other hand, a single  needle-machine makes 145,000 in a working-day of 11 hours. One woman or  one girl superintends four such machines, and so produces near upon 600,000  needles in a day, and upwards of 3,000,000 in a week.  ","Machinery

1748,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"Along with the development of the factory system and of the revolution  in agriculture that accompanies it, production in all the other branches  of industry not only extends, but alters its character. The principle,  carried out in the factory system, of analysing the process of production  into its constituent phases, and of solving the problems thus proposed  by the application of mechanics, of chemistry, and of the whole range of  the natural sciences, becomes the determining principle everywhere. Hence,  machinery squeezes itself into the manufacturing industries first for one  detail process, then for another. Thus the solid crystal of their organisation,  based on the old division of labour, becomes dissolved, and makes way for  constant changes. Independently of this, a radical change takes place in  the composition of the collective labourer, a change of the persons working  in combination. In contrast with the manufacturing period, the division  of labour is thenceforth based, wherever possible, on the employment of  women, of children of all ages, and of unskilled labourers, in one word,  on cheap labour, as it is characteristically called in England. This is  the case not only with all production on a large scale, whether employing  machinery or not, but also with the so-called domestic industry, whether  carried on in the houses of the workpeople or in small workshops. This  modern so-called domestic industry has nothing, except the name, in common  with the old-fashioned domestic industry, the existence of which pre-supposes  independent urban handicrafts, independent peasant farming, and above all,  a dwelling-house for the labourer and his family. That old-fashioned industry  has now been converted into an outside department of the factory, the manufactory,  or the warehouse. Besides the factory operatives, the manufacturing workmen  and the handicraftsman, whom it concentrates in large masses at one spot,  and directly commands, capital also sets in motion, by means, of invisible  threads, another army; that of the workers in the domestic industries,  who dwell in the large towns and are also scattered over the face of the  country. An example: The shirt factory of Messrs. Tillie at Londonderry,  which employs 1,000 operatives in the factory itself, and 9,000 people  spread up and down the country and working in their own houses.  ","Machinery

This is because the technical foundation of the factory system,  namely, the substitution of machines for muscular power, and the light character  of the labour, is almost entirely absent in Manufacture, and at the same  time women and over-young children are subjected, in a most unconscionable  way, to the influence of poisonous or injurious substances. This exploitation  is more shameless in the so-called domestic industry than in manufactures,  and that because the power of resistance in the labourers decreases with  their dissemination; because a whole series of plundering parasites insinuate  themselves between the employer and the workman; because a domestic industry  has always to compete either with the factory system, or with manufacturing  in the same branch of production; because poverty robs the workman of the  conditions most essential to his labour, of space, light and ventilation;  because employment becomes more and more irregular; and, finally, because  in these the last resorts of the masses made “redundant” by modern industry  and Agriculture, competition for work attains its maximum. Economy in the  means of production, first systematically carried out in the factory system,  and there, from the very beginning, coincident with the most reckless squandering  of labour-power, and robbery of the conditions normally requisite for labour  — this economy now shows its antagonistic and murderous side more and  more in a given branch of industry, the less the social productive power  of labour and the technical basis for a combination of processes are developed  in that branch.

1750,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"I now proceed, by a few examples, to illustrate the principles laid  down above. As a matter of fact, the reader is already familiar with numerous  instances given in the chapter on the working-day. In the hardware manufactures  of Birmingham and the neighbourhood, there are employed, mostly in very  heavy work, 30,000 children and young persons, besides 10,000 women. There  they are to be seen in the unwholesome brass-foundries, button factories,  enamelling, galvanising, and lackering works.  A classical example of over-work, of hard and inappropriate labour, and of its brutalising effects on the  workman from his childhood upwards, is afforded not only by coal-mining  and miners generally, but also by tile and brick making, in which industry  the recently invented machinery is, in England, used only here and there.  Between May and September the work lasts from 5 in the morning till 8 in  the evening, and where the drying is done in the open air, it often lasts  from 4 in the morning till 9 in the evening. Work from 5 in the morning  till 7 in the evening is considered “reduced” and “moderate.” Both boys  and girls of 6 and even of 4 years of age are employed. They work for the  same number of hours, often longer, than the adults. The work is hard and  the summer heat increases the exhaustion. In a certain tile-field at Mosley,  e.g., a young woman, 24 years of age, was in the habit of making 2,000  tiles a day, with the assistance of 2 little girls, who carried the clay  for her, and stacked the tiles. These girls carried daily 10 tons up the  slippery sides of the clay pits, from a depth of 30 feet, and then for  a distance of 210 feet.","Machinery

A frightful source of demoralisation is the mode of living. Each moulder,  who is always a skilled labourer, and the chief of a group, supplies his  7 subordinates with board and lodging in his cottage. Whether members of  his family or not, the men, boys, and girls all sleep in the cottage, which  contains generally two, exceptionally 3 rooms, all on the ground floor,  and badly ventilated. These people are so exhausted after the day’s hard  work, that neither the rules of health, of cleanliness, nor of decency  are in the least observed. Many of these cottages are models  of untidiness, dirt, and dust.... The greatest evil of the system that  employs young girls on this sort of work, consists in this, that, as a  rule, it chains them fast from childhood for the whole of their after-life  to the most abandoned rabble. They become rough, foul-mouthed boys, before  Nature has taught them that they are women. Clothed in a few dirty rags,  the legs naked far above the knees, hair and face besmeared with dirt,  they learn to treat all feelings of decency and of shame with contempt.  During meal-times they lie at full length in the fields, or watch the boys  bathing in a neighbouring canal.

I pointed out, that while the workpeople are practically incapable  of doing themselves this sanitary justice, they are unable to obtain any  effective support from the paid administrations of the sanitary police....

The  branches that we are now about to examine, solely with regard to those  of the workpeople who work at home, and not those who work in manufactories  or warehouses, fall into two divisions, viz. (1), finishing; (2), mending.  The former gives the finishing touches to the machine-made lace, and includes  numerous sub-divisions.  ","Machinery

1761,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm,"The lace finishing is done either in what are called “mistresses’  houses,” or by women in their own houses, with or without the help of their  children. The women who keep the “mistresses’ houses” are themselves poor.  The workroom is in a private house. The mistresses take orders from manufacturers,  or from warehousemen, and employ as many women, girls, and young children  as the size of their rooms and the fluctuating demand of the business will  allow. The number of the workwomen employed in these workrooms varies from  20 to 40 in some, and from 10 to 20 in others. The average age at which  the children commence work is six years, but in many cases it is below  five. The usual working-hours are from 8 in the morning till eight in the  evening, with 1½ hours for meals, which are taken at irregular intervals,  and often in the foul workrooms. When business is brisk, the labour frequently  lasts from 8 or even 6 o’clock in the morning till 10, 11, or 12 o’clock  at night. In English barracks the regulation space allotted to each soldier  is 500-600 cubic feet, and in the military hospitals 1,200 cubic feet.  But in those finishing sties there are but 67 to 100 cubic feet to each  person. At the same time the oxygen of the air is consumed by gas-lights.  In order to keep the lace clean, and although the floor is tiled or gagged,  the children are often compelled, even in winter, to pull off their shoes.","Machinery

This sort of work is  given out within a circle of 80 miles radius from Nottingham. On leaving  the warehouses at 9 or 10 o’clock at night, the children are often given  a bundle of lace to take home with them and finish. The Pharisee of a capitalist  represented by one of his servants, accompanies this action, of course,  with the unctuous phrase: “That’s for mother,” yet he knows well enough  that the poor children must sit up and help.

The cottages of the agricultural labourers are the  places where the work is usually carried on. Many manufacturers employ  upwards of 3,000 of these lace-makers, who are chiefly children and young  persons of the female sex exclusively. The state of things described as  incidental to lace finishing is here repeated, save that instead of the   “mistresses’ houses,” we find what are called “lace-schools,” kept by poor  women in their cottages. From their fifth year and often earlier, until  their twelfth or fifteenth year, the children work in these schools; during  the first year the very young ones work from four to eight hours, and later  on, from six in the morning till eight and ten o’clock at night.","Machinery

Added to this is the injurious effect of drains, privies, decomposing substances,  and other filth usual in the purlieus of the smaller cottages.” With regard  to space: “In one lace-school 18 girls and a mistress, 35 cubic  feet to each person; in another, where the smell was unbearable, 18 persons  and 24½ cubic feet per head.

In the place of the lace-schools we find here  the “straw-plait schools.” The children commence their instruction in straw-plaiting  generally in their 4th, often between their 3rd and 4th year. Education,  of course, they get none. The children themselves call the elementary schools,   “natural schools,” to distinguish them from these blood-sucking institutions,  in which they are kept at work simply to get through the task, generally  30 yards daily, prescribed by their half-starved mothers. These same mothers  often make them work at home, after school is over, till 10, 11, and 12  o’clock at night. The straw cuts their mouths, with which they constantly  moisten it, and their fingers. Dr. Ballard gives it as the general opinion  of the whole body of medical officers in London, that 300 cubic feet is  the minimum space proper for each person in a bedroom or workroom.

It was in fact by the cheapness  of the human sweat and the human blood, which were converted into commodities,  that the markets were constantly being extended, and continue daily to  be extended; more especially was this the case with England’s colonial  markets, where, besides, English tastes and habits prevail.

Children of too tender an age are sent adrift. The wage of the  machine hands rises compared with that of the house-workers, many of  whom belong to the poorest of the poor. That of the better situated handicraftsman,  with whom the machine competes, sinks. The new machine hands are exclusively  girls and young women. With the help of mechanical force, they destroy  the monopoly that male labour had of the heavier work, and they drive off  from the lighter work numbers of old women and very young children. The  overpowering competition crushes the weakest of the manual labourers. The  fearful increase in death from starvation during the last 10 years in London  runs parallel with the extension of machine sewing.  The new workwomen turn the machines by hand and foot, or by hand alone, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, according to the weight, size, and  special make of the machine, and expend a great deal of labour-power. Their  occupation is unwholesome, owing to the long hours, although in most cases  they are not so long as under the old system. Wherever the sewing-machine  locates itself in narrow and already over-crowded workrooms, it adds to  the unwholesome influences.","Machinery

The heat, partly due to the gas stoves used for warming the irons, is horrible....

The compulsory  regulation of the working-day as regards its length, pauses, beginning  and end, the system of relays of children, the exclusion of all children  under a certain age, &c., necessitate on the one hand more machinery   On the other hand, in order to make up for the loss of time, an expansion occurs of the means  of production used in common, of the furnaces, buildings, &c., in one  word, greater concentration of the means of production and a correspondingly  greater concourse of workpeople. The chief objection, repeatedly and passionately  urged on behalf of each manufacture threatened with the Factory Act, is  in fact this, that in order to continue the business on the old scale a  greater outlay of capital will be necessary. But as regards labour in the  so-called domestic industries and the intermediate forms between them and  Manufacture, so soon as limits are put to the working-day and to the employment  of children, those industries go to the wall. Unlimited exploitation  of cheap labour-power is the sole foundation of their power to compete.  ","Machinery

The statutory pauses in the  working-day, moreover, imply the assumption that periodical and sudden  cessation of the work does no harm to the article undergoing the process  of production. This certainty in the result, and this possibility of interrupting  the work are, of course, easier to be attained in the purely mechanical  industries than in those in which chemical and physical processes play  a part; as, for instance, in the earthenware trade, in bleaching, dyeing,  baking, and in most of the metal industries. Wherever there is a workingday  without restriction as to length, wherever there is night-work and unrestricted  waste of human life, there the slightest obstacle presented by the nature  of the work to a change for the better is soon looked upon as an everlasting  barrier erected by Nature. No poison kills vermin with more certainty than  the Factory Act removes such everlasting barriers. No one made a greater  outcry over “impossibilities” than our friends the earthenware manufacturers.  In 1864, however, they were brought under the Act, and within sixteen months  every “impossibility” had vanished.","Machinery

In the manufacture of matches  it was thought to be an indispensable requirement, that boys, even while  bolting their dinner, should go on dipping the matches in melted phosphorus,  the poisonous vapour from which rose into their faces. The Factory Act  (1864) made the saving of time a necessity, and so forced into existence  a dipping machine, the vapour from which could not come in contact with  the workers.  So, at the present time, in those branches of the lace manufacture not yet subject to the Factory  Act, it is maintained that the meal-times cannot be regular owing to the  different periods required by the various kinds of lace for drying, which  periods vary from three minutes up to an hour and more.

Some of the principal manufacturers in the trade urged that in consequence  of the nature of the materials used, and their various processes, they  would be unable, without serious loss, to stop for meal-times at any given  moment. But it was seen from the evidence that, by due care and previous  arrangement, the apprehended difficulty would be got over; and accordingly,  by clause 6 of section 6 of the Factory Acts Extension Act, passed during this Session of Parliament, an interval of eighteen months is given to  them from the passing of the Act before they are required to conform to  the meal hours, specified by the Factory Acts.” ","Machinery

Hence, on the introduction of the Factory  Act into a given industry, a period varying from six to eighteen months  is fixed within which it is incumbent on the manufacturers to remove all  technical impediments to the working of the Act. Mirabeau’s “Impossible!  ne me dites jamais ce bête de mot!” is particularly applicable to  modern technology. But though the Factory Acts thus artificially ripen  the material elements necessary for the conversion of the manufacturing  system into the factory system, yet at the same time, owing to the necessity  they impose for greater outlay of capital, they hasten on the decline of  the small masters, and the concentration of capital.

Although this absence of regularity in the expenditure of labour-power is a natural and rude reaction against the tedium of monotonous drudgery,  it originates, also, to a much greater degree from anarchy in production,  anarchy that in its turn pre-supposes unbridled exploitation of labour-power  by the capitalist. Besides the general periodic changes of the industrial  cycle, and the special fluctuations in the markets to which each industry  is subject, we may also reckon what is called “the season,” dependent either  on the periodicity of favourable seasons of the year for navigation; or  on fashion, and the sudden placing of large orders that have to be executed  in the shortest possible time.

In the outside  department of the factory, of the manufactory, and of the warehouse,  the so-called domestic workers, whose employment is at the best irregular,  are entirely dependent for their raw material and their orders on the caprice  of the capitalist, who, in this industry, is not hampered by any regard  for depreciation of his buildings and machinery, and risks nothing by a  stoppage of work, but the skin of the worker himself. Here then he sets  himself systematically to work to form an industrial reserve force that  shall be ready at a moment’s notice; during one part of the year he decimates  this force by the most inhuman toil, during the other part, he lets it  starve for want of work.

In the third book we shall return again to the fanatical opposition of  the masters to those clauses which imposed upon them a slight expenditure  on appliances for protecting the limbs of their workpeople, an opposition  that throws a fresh and glaring light on the Free-trade dogma, according  to which, in a society with conflicting interests, each individual necessarily  furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantage!  One example is enough. The reader knows that during the last 20 years,  the flax industry has very much extended, and that, with that extension,  the number of scutching mills in Ireland has increased. In 1864 there were  in that country 1,800 of these mills. Regularly in autumn and winter women  and “young persons,” the wives, sons, and daughters of the neighbouring  small farmers, a class of people totally unaccustomed to machinery, are  taken from field labour to feed the rollers of the scutching mills with  flax. The accidents, both as regards number and kind, are wholly unexampled  in the history of machinery. In one scutching mill, at Kildinan, near Cork,  there occurred between 1852 and 1856, six fatal accidents and sixty mutilations;  every one of which might have been prevented by the simplest appliances,  at the cost of a few shillings.

In many cases a quarter of the body is torn from the  trunk, and either involves death, or a future of wretched incapacity and  suffering. The increase of mills in the country will, of course, extend  these dreadful results, and it will be a great boon if they are brought  under the legislature.

In the potteries the Factory Act of 1864 “has whitewashed and  cleansed upwards of 200 workshops, after a period of abstinence from any  such cleaning, in many cases of 20 years, and in some, entirely,” (this  is the “abstinence” of the capitalist!) “in which were employed 27,800  artisans, hitherto breathing through protracted days and often nights of  labour, a mephitic atmosphere, and which rendered an otherwise comparatively  innocuous occupation, pregnant with disease and death.

It has been stated over and over again that the  English doctors are unanimous in declaring that where the work is continuous,  500 cubic feet is the very least space that should be allowed for each  person. Now, if the Factory Acts, owing to their compulsory provisions,  indirectly hasten on the conversion of small workshops into factories,  thus indirectly attacking the proprietary rights of the smaller capitalists,  and assuring a monopoly to the great ones, so, if it were made obligatory  to provide the proper space for each workman in every workshop, thousands  of small employers would, at one full swoop, be expropriated directly!  The very root of the capitalist mode of production, i.e., the self-expansion  of all capital, large or small, by means of the “free” purchase and consumption  of labour-power, would be attacked. Factory legislation is therefore brought  to a deadlock before these 500 cubic feet of breathing space. The sanitary  officers, the industrial inquiry commissioners, the factory inspectors,  all harp, over and over again, upon the necessity for those 500 cubic feet,  and upon the impossibility of wringing them out of capital.

In the English  letter-press printing trade, for example, there existed formerly a system,  corresponding to that in the old manufactures and handicrafts, of advancing  the apprentices from easy to more and more difficult work. They went through  a course of teaching till they were finished printers. To be able to read  and write was for every one of them a requirement of their trade. All this  was changed by the printing machine. It employs two sorts of labourers,  one grown up, renters, the other, boys mostly from 11 to 17 years of age  whose sole business is either to spread the sheets of paper under the machine,  or to take from it the printed sheets. They perform this weary task, in London especially, for 14, 15, and 16 hours at a stretch, during several  days in the week, and frequently for 36 hours, with only 2 hours’ rest  for meals and sleep.

The  principle which it pursued, of resolving each process into its constituent  movements, without any regard to their possible execution by the hand of  man, created the new modern science of technology. The varied, apparently  unconnected, and petrified forms of the industrial processes now  resolved themselves into so many conscious and systematic applications  of natural science to the attainment of given useful effects. Technology  also discovered the few main fundamental forms of motion, which, despite  the diversity of the instruments used, are necessarily taken by every productive  action of the human body; just as the science of mechanics sees in the  most complicated machinery nothing but the continual repetition of the  simple mechanical powers.

It becomes a question of life and death for society  to adapt the mode of production to the normal functioning of this law.  Modern Industry, indeed, compels society, under penalty of death, to replace  the detail-worker of to-day, grappled by life-long repetition of one and  the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to the mere fragment of a  man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours, ready  to face any change of production, and to whom the different social functions  he performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural  and acquired powers.

Though the Factory Act, that first  and meagre concession wrung from capital, is limited to combining elementary  education with work in the factory, there can be no doubt that when the  working-class comes into power, as inevitably it must, technical instruction,  both theoretical and practical, will take its proper place in the working-class  schools. There is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments, the final  result of which is the abolition of the old division of labour, are diametrically  opposed to the capitalistic form of production, and to the economic status  of the labourer corresponding to that form. But the historical development  of the antagonisms, immanent in a given form of production, is the only  way in which that form of production can be dissolved and a new form established.   “Ne sutor ultra crepidam” — this nec plus ultra of handicraft wisdom became  sheer nonsense, from the moment the watchmaker Watt invented the steam-engine,  the barber Arkwright, the throstle, and the working-jeweller, Fulton, the  steamship.

The tender-hearted English Parliament long affected to shrink from taking  this step. The force of facts, however, compelled it at last to acknowledge  that modern industry, in overturning the economic foundation on which was  based the traditional family, and the family labour corresponding to it,  had also unloosened all traditional family ties.

Parents must not possess the  absolute power of making their children mere ‘machines to earn so much  weekly wage....’ The children and young persons, therefore, in all such  cases may justifiably claim from the legislature, as a natural right, that  an exemption should be secured to them, from what destroys prematurely  their physical strength, and lowers them in the scale of intellectual and  moral beings.” ","Machinery

However terrible and disgusting the dissolution,  under the capitalist system, of the old family ties may appear, nevertheless,  modern industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the process  of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons,  and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a  higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes. It is,  of course, just as absurd to hold the Teutonic-Christian form of the family  to be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the  ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, or the Eastern forms which, moreover,  taken together form a series in historical development. Moreover, it is  obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of  individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable  conditions, become a source of humane development; although in its spontaneously  developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the labourer exists for the  process of production, and not the process of production for the labourer,  that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery.

In the rear of that industry, the traditional  form of manufacture, of handicraft, and of domestic industry, is entirely  revolutionised; manufactures are constantly passing into the factory system,  and handicrafts into manufactures; and lastly, the spheres of handicraft and of the domestic industries become, in a, comparatively speaking, wonderfully  short time, dens of misery in which capitalistic exploitation obtains free  play for the wildest excesses. There are two circumstances that finally  turn the scale: first, the constantly recurring experience that capital,  so soon as it finds itself subject to legal control at one point, compensates  itself all the more recklessly at other points;  On this point let us listen to two heart-broken cries. Messrs. Cooksley of Bristol, nail and chain, &c., manufacturers, spontaneously introduced the regulations of the Factory Act into their business.","Machinery

It is the  work of a man... a strong man.” (ns. 1753, 1793, 1794.) “Your feeling upon  the whole subject is that the better class of colliers who desire to raise  themselves and humanise themselves, instead of deriving help from the women,  are pulled down by them?” “Yes.” (n. 1808.)

It destroys both the ancient and the  transitional forms, behind which the dominion of capital is still in part  concealed, and replaces them by the direct and open sway of capital; but  thereby it also generalises the direct opposition to this sway.

By the destruction of petty and domestic  industries it destroys the last resort of the “redundant population,” and  with it the sole remaining safety-valve of the whole social mechanism.

In  the counties of Cambridge and Suffolk, for example, the area of cultivated  land has extended very much within the last 20 years (up to 1868), while  in the same period the rural population has diminished, not only relatively,  but absolutely. In the United States it is as yet only virtually that agricultural  machines replace labourers; in other words, they allow of the cultivation  by the farmer of a larger surface, but do not actually expel the labourers  employed. In 1861 the number of persons occupied in England and Wales in  the manufacture of agricultural machines was 1,034, whilst the number of  agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and  steam-engines did not exceed 1,205.

Thus the desire for social changes, and the class antagonisms are brought  to the same level in the country as in the towns. The irrational, old-fashioned  methods of agriculture are replaced by scientific ones. Capitalist production  completely tears asunder the old bond of union which held together agriculture  and manufacture in their infancy. But at the same time it creates the material  conditions for a higher synthesis in the future, viz., the union of agriculture  and industry on the basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired  during their temporary separation. Capitalist production, by collecting  the population in great centres, and causing an ever-increasing preponderance  of town population, on the one hand concentrates the historical motive  power of society; on the other hand, it disturbs the circulation of matter  between man and the soil, i.e., prevents the return to the soil of its  elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; it therefore  violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil. By  this action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer  and the intellectual life of the rural labourer.

Before his time, spinning machines, although very imperfect ones, had already been used, and Italy was probably the country of their first appearance. A critical history of technology would show how little any of the inventions of the 18th century are the work of a single individual. Hitherto there is no such book. Darwin has interested us in the history of Nature’s Technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs of plants and animals, which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation, deserve equal attention? And would not such a history be easier to compile, since, as Vico says, human history differs from natural history in this, that we have made the former, but not the latter? Technology discloses man’s mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them. Every history of religion, even, that fails to take account of this material basis, is uncritical. It is, in reality, much easier to discover by analysis the earthly core of the misty creations of religion, than, conversely, it is, to develop from the actual relations of life the corresponding celestialised forms of those relations. The latter method is the only materialistic, and therefore the only scientific one.

Morton read before the Society of Arts a paper on “The forces employed in agriculture.” He there states: “Every improvement that furthers the uniformity of the land makes the steam-engine more and more applicable to the production of pure mechanical force.... Horse-power is requisite wherever crooked fences and other obstructions prevent uniform action. These obstructions are vanishing day by day. For operations that demand more exercise of will than actual force, the only power applicable is that controlled every instant by the human mind-in other words, man-power.” Mr. Morton then reduces steam-power, horse-power, and man-power, to the unit in general use for steam-engines, namely, the force required to raise 33,000 lbs. one foot in one minute, and reckons the cost of one horse-power from a steam-engine to be 3d., and from a horse to be 5½d. per hour. Further, if a horse must fully maintain its health, it can work no more than 8 hours a day. Three at the least out of every seven horses used on tillage land during the year can be dispensed with by using steam-power, at an expense not greater than that which, the horses dispensed with, would cost during the 3 or 4 months in which alone they can be used effectively. Lastly, steam-power, in those agricultural operations in which it can be employed, improves, in comparison with horse-power, the quality of the work. To do the work of a steam-engine would require 66 men, at a total cost of 15s. an hour, and to do the work of a horse, 32 men, at a total cost of 8s. an hour.  ","Machinery

From the standpoint of division of labour in Manufacture, weaving was not simple, but, on the contrary, complicated manual labour; and consequently the power-loom is a machine that does very complicated work. It is altogether erroneous to suppose that modern machinery originally appropriated those operations alone, which division of labour had simplified. Spinning and weaving were, during the manufacturing period, split up into new species, and the implements were modified and improved; but the labour itself was in no way divided, and it retained its handicraft character.

Hence it was in this industry that, in the first half of the 18th century, the most experiments were made. Cotton, which required less careful preparation for its treatment by machinery, derived the benefit of the experience gained on wool, just as afterwards the manipulation of wool by machinery was developed on the lines of cotton-spinning and weaving by machinery. It was only during the 10 years immediately preceding 1866, that isolated details of the wool manufacture, such as woolcombing, were incorporated in the factory system. “The application of power to the process of combing wool ... extensively in operation since the introduction of the combingmachine, especially Lister’s ... undoubtedly had the effect of throwing a very large number of men out of work. Wool was formerly combed by hand, most frequently in the cottage of the comber. It is now very generally combed in the factory, and hand-labour is superseded, except in some particular kinds of work, in which hand-combed wool is still preferred. Many of the hand-combers found employment in the factories, but the produce of the hand-combers bears so small a proportion to that of the machine, that the employment of a very large number of combers has passed away.” (“Rep. of lnsp. of Fact. for 31st Oct., 1856,” p. 16.)

Ricardo lays such stress on this effect of machinery (of which, in other connexions, he takes no more notice than he does of the general distinction between the labour process and the process of creating surplus-value), that he occasionally loses sight of the value given up by machines to the product, and puts machines on the same footing as natural forces. Thus “Adam Smith nowhere undervalues the services which the natural agents and machinery perform for us, but he very justly distinguishes the nature of the value which they add to commodities... as they perform their work gratuitously, the assistance which they afford us, adds nothing to value in exchange.” (Ric., l.c., pp. 336, 337.)

A horse-power is equal to a force of 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, i.e., to a force that raises 33,000 pounds one foot in a minute, or one pound 33,000 feet. This is the horse power meant in the text. In ordinary language, and also here and there in quotations in this work, a distinction is drawn between the “nominal” and the “commercial” or “indicated” horse-power of the same engine. The old or nominal horse-power is calculated exclusively from the length of piston-stroke, and the diameter of the cylinder, and leaves pressure of steam and piston speed out of consideration. It expresses practically this: This engine would be one of 50 horse-power, if it were driven with the same low pressure of steam, and the same slow piston speed, as in the days of Boulton and Watt. But the two latter factors have increased enormously since those days. In order to measure the mechanical force exerted today by an engine, an indicator has been invented which shows the pressure of the steam in the cylinder. The piston speed is easily ascertained. Thus the “indicated” or “commercial” horse-power of an engine is expressed by a mathematical formula, involving diameter of cylinder, length of stroke, piston speed, and steam pressure, simultaneously, and showing what multiple of 33,000 pounds is really raised by the engine in a minute. Hence, one “nominal” horse-power may exert three, four, or even five “indicated” or “real” horse-powers.

It is, however, easily seen that since a machine no more creates new value than any other part of constant capital, it cannot add any value under the name of “interest.” It is also evident that here, where we are treating of the production of surplus-value, we cannot assume a priori the existence of any part of that value under the name of interest. The capitalist mode of calculating, which appears, primâ facie, absurd, and repugnant to the laws of the creation of value, will be explained in the third book of this work.  ","Machinery

This portion of value which is added by the machinery, decreases both absolutely and relatively, when the machinery does away with horses and other animals that are employed as mere moving forces, and not as machines for changing the form of matter. It may here be incidentally observed, that Descartes, in defining animals as mere machines, saw with eyes of the manufacturing period, while to eyes of the middle ages, animals were assistants to man, as they were later to Von Haller in his “Restauration der Staatswissenschaften.” That Descartes, like Bacon, anticipated an alteration in the form of production, and the practical subjugation of Nature by Man, as a result of the altered methods of thought, is plain from his “Discours de la Méthode.” He there says: “Il est possible (by the methods he introduced in philosophy) de parvenir à des connaissances fort utiles à la vie, et qu’au lieu de cette philosophie spéculative qu’on enseigne dans les écoles, on en peut trouver une pratique, par laquelle, connaissant la force et les actions du feu, de l’eau, de l’air, des astres, et de tous les autres corps qui nous environnent, aussi distinctement que nous connaissons les divers métiers de nos artisans, nous les pourrions employer en même façon à tous les usages auxquels ils sont propres, et ainsi nous rendre comme maîtres et possesseurs de la nature” and thus “contribuer au perfectionnement de la vie humaine.”  of Political Economy in England, France, and Italy, was Locke.

Dr. Edward Smith, during the cotton crisis caused by the American Civil War, was sent by the English Government to Lancashire, Cheshire, and other places, to report on the sanitary condition of the cotton operatives. He reported, that from a hygienic point of view, and apart from the banishment of the operatives from the factory atmosphere, the crisis had several advantages. The women now had sufficient leisure to give their infants the breast, instead of poisoning them with “Godfrey’s cordial.” They had time to learn to cook. Unfortunately the acquisition of this art occurred at a time when they had nothing to cook. But from this we see how capital, for the purposes of its self-expansion, has usurped the labour necessary in the home of the family. This crisis was also utilised to teach sewing to the daughters of the workmen in sewing schools. An American revolution and a universal crisis, in order that the working girls, who spin for the whole world, might learn to sew!  ","Machinery

Three girls of 13, at wages of from 6 shillings to 8 shillings a week, have replaced the one man of mature age, of wages varying from 18 shillings to 45 shillings.” (Th. de Quincey: “The Logic of Political Econ.,” London, 1844. Note to p. 147.) Since certain family functions, such as nursing and suckling children, cannot be entirely suppressed, the mothers confiscated by capital, must try substitutes of some sort. Domestic work, such as sewing and mending, must be replaced by the purchase of ready-made articles. Hence, the diminished expenditure of labour in the house is accompanied by an increased expenditure of money. The cost of keeping the family increases, and balances the greater income. In addition to this, economy and judgment in the consumption and preparation of the means of subsistence becomes impossible. Abundant material relating to these facts, which are concealed by official Political Economy, is to be found in the Reports of the Inspectors of Factories, of the Children’s Employment Commission, and more especially in the Reports on Public Health.

In striking contrast with the great fact, that the shortening of the hours of labour of women and children in English factories was exacted from capital by the male operatives, we find in the latest reports of the Children’s Employment Commission traits of the operative parents in relation to the traffic in children, that are truly revolting and thoroughly like slave-dealing. But the Pharisee of a capitalist, as may be seen from the same reports, denounces this brutality which he himself creates, perpetuates, and exploits, and which he moreover baptises “freedom of labour.” “Infant labour has been called into aid ... even to work for their own daily bread. Without strength to endure such disproportionate toil, without instruction to guide their future life, they have been thrown into a situation physically and morally polluted. The Jewish historian has remarked upon the overthrow of Jerusalem by Titus that it was no wonder it should have been destroyed, with such a signal destruction, when an inhuman mother sacrificed her own offspring to satisfy the cravings of absolute hunger.” (“Public Economy Concentrated.” Carlisle, 1833, p. 66.)

The English, who have a tendency to look upon the earliest form of appearance of a thing as the cause of its existence, are in the habit of attributing the long hours of work in factories to the extensive kidnapping of children, practised by capitalists in the infancy of the factory system, on workhouses and orphanages, by means of which robbery, unresisting material for exploitation was procured. Thus, for instance, Ficiden, himself a manufacturer, says: “It is evident that the long hours of work were brought about by the circumstance of so great a number of destitute children being supplied from different parts of the country, that the masters were independent of the hands, and that having once established the custom by means of the miserable materials they had procured in this way, they could impose it on their neighbours with the greater facility.” (J.

The English “ateliers nationaux”  of 1862 and the following years, established for the benefit of the destitute cotton operatives, differ from the French of 1848 in this, that in the latter the workmen had to do unproductive work at the expense of the state, in the former they had to do productive municipal work to the advantage of the bourgeois, and that, too, cheaper than the regular workmen, with whom they were thus thrown into competition. “The physical appearance of the cotton operatives is unquestionably improved.

An example: The various mechanical apparatus introduced since the Act of 1844 into woollen mills, for replacing the labour of children. So soon as it shall happen that the children of the manufacturers themselves have to go through a course of schooling as helpers in the mill, this almost unexplored territory of mechanics will soon make remarkable progress. “Of machinery, perhaps self-acting mules are as dangerous as any other kind. Most of the accidents from them happen to little children, from their creeping under the mules to sweep the floor whilst the mules are in motion. Several ‘minders’ have been fined for this offence, but without much general benefit. If machine makers would only invent a self-sweeper, by whose use the necessity for these little children to creep under the machinery might be prevented, it would be a happy addition to our protective measures.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact. for 31st.

In it all freedom comes to an end both at law and in fact. The workman must be in the factory at half past five. If he come a few minutes late, he is punished; if he come 10 minutes late, he is not allowed to enter until after breakfast, and thus loses a quarter of a day’s wage. He must eat, drink and sleep at word of command.... The despotic bell calls him from his bed, calls him from breakfast and dinner. And how does he fare in the mill? There the master is the absolute law-giver. He makes what regulations he pleases; he alters and makes additions to his code at pleasure; and if he insert the veriest nonsense, the courts say to the workman: Since you have entered into this contract voluntarily, you must now carry it out .... These workmen are condemned to live, from their ninth year till their death, under this mental and bodily torture.” (F. Engels, l.c., p. 217, sq.) What, “the courts say,” I will illustrate by two examples. One occurs at Sheffield at the end of 1866. In that town a workman had engaged himself for 2 years in a steelworks. In consequence of a quarrel with his employer he left the works, and declared that under no circumstances would he work for that master any more. He was prosecuted for breach of contract, and condemned to two months’ imprisonment. (If the master break the contract, he can be proceeded against only in a civil action, and risks nothing but money damages.) After the workman has served his two months, the master invites him to return to the works, pursuant to the contract. Workman says: No, he has already been punished for the breach. The master prosecutes again, the court condemns again, although one of the judges, Mr. Shee, publicly denounces this as a legal monstrosity, by which a man can periodically, as long as he lives, be punished over and over again for the same offence or crime. This judgment was given not by the “Great Unpaid,” the provincial Dogberries, but by one of the highest courts of justice in London. —  The second case occurs in Wiltshire at the end of November 1863. About 30 power-loom weavers, in the employment of one Harrup, a cloth manufacturer at Leower’s Mill, Westbury Leigh, struck work because master Harrup indulged in the agreeable habit of making deductions from their wages for being late in the morning; 6d. for 2 minutes; 1s. for 3 minutes, and 1s. 6d. for ten minutes. This is at the rate of 9s. per hour, and £4 10s. 0d. per diem; while the wages of the weavers on the average of a year, never exceeded 10s. to 12s. weekly. Harrup also appointed a boy to announce the starting time by a whistle, which he often did before six o’clock in the morning: and if the hands were not all there at the moment the whistle ceased, the doors were closed, and those hands who were outside were fined: and as there was no clock on the premises, the unfortunate hands were at the mercy of the young Harrup-inspired time-keeper. The hands on strike, mothers of families as well as girls, offered to resume work if the timekeeper were replaced by a clock, and a more reasonable scale of fines were introduced. Harrup summoned I9 women and girls before the magistrates for breach of contract. To the utter indignation of all present, they were each mulcted in a fine of 6d. and 2s. 6d. for costs. Harrup was followed from the court by a crowd of people who hissed him. A favourite operation with manufacturers is to punish the workpeople by deductions made from their wages on account of faults in the material worked on. This method gave rise in 1866 to a general strike in the English pottery districts. The reports of the Ch. Empl. Com. (1863-1866), give cases where the worker not only receives no wages, but becomes, by means of his labour, and of the penal regulations, the debtor to boot, of his worthy master. The late cotton crisis also furnished edifying examples of the sagacity shown by the factory autocrats in making deductions from wages. Mr. R. Baker, the Inspector of Factories, says, “I have myself had lately to direct prosecutions against one cotton mill occupier for having in these pinching and painful times deducted 10d. a piece from some of the young workers employed by him, for the surgeon’s certificate (for which he himself had only paid 6d.), when only allowed by the law to deduct 3d., and by custom nothing at all .... And I have been informed of another, who, in order to keep without the law, but to attain the same object, charges the poor children who work for him a shilling each, as a fee for learning them the art and mystery of cotton spinning, so soon as they are declared by the surgeon fit and proper persons for that occupation. There may therefore be undercurrent causes for such extraordinary exhibitions as strikes, not only wherever they arise, but particularly at such times as the present, which without explanation, render them inexplicable to the public understanding.” He alludes here to a strike of power-loom weavers at Darwen, June, 1863. (“Reports of Insp. of Fact. for 30 April, 1863,” pp. 50-51.) The reports always go beyond their official dates.  ","Machinery

The protection afforded by the Factory Acts against dangerous machinery has had a beneficial effect. “But ... there are other sources of accident which did not exist twenty years since; one especially, viz., the increased speed of the machinery. Wheels, rollers, spindles and shuttles are now propelled at increased and increasing rates; fingers must be quicker and defter in their movements to take up the broken thread, for, if placed with hesitation or carelessness, they are sacrificed.... A large number of accidents are caused by the eagerness of the workpeople to get through their work expeditiously. It must be remembered that it is of the highest importance to manufacturers that their machinery should be in motion, i.e., producing yarns and goods. Every minute’s stoppage is not only a loss of power, but of production, and the workpeople are urged by the overlookers, who are interested in the quantity of work turned off, to keep the machinery in motion, and it is no less important to those of the operatives who are paid by the weight or piece, that the machines should be kept in motion. Consequently, although it is strictly forbidden in many, nay in most factories, that machinery should be cleaned while in motion, it is nevertheless the constant practice in most, if not in all, that the workpeople do, unreproved, pick out waste, wipe rollers and wheels, &c., while their frames are in motion. Thus from this cause only, 906 accidents have occurred during the six months.... Although a great deal of cleaning is constantly going on day by day, yet Saturday is generally the day set apart for the thorough cleaning of the machinery, and a great deal of this is done while the machinery is in motion.” Since cleaning is not paid for, the workpeople seek to get done with it as speedily as possible. Hence “the number of accidents which occur on Fridays, and especially on Saturdays, is much larger than on any other day. On the former day the excess is nearly 12 per cent. over the average number of the four first days of the week, and on the latter day the excess is 25 per cent. over the average of the preceding five days; or, if the number of working-hours on Saturday being taken into account — 7½ hours on Saturday as compared with 10½ on other days — there is an excess of 65 per cent. on Saturdays over the average of the other five days.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1866,” pp. 9, 15, 16, 17.)

I shall give an account of a recent campaign by the English manufacturers against the Clauses in the Factory Acts that protect the “hands” against dangerous machinery. For the present, let this one quotation from the official report of Leonard Horner suffice: “I have heard some mill-owners speak with inexcusable levity of some of the accidents; such, for instance, as the loss of a finger being a trifling matter. A working-man’s living and prospects depend so much upon his fingers, that any loss of them is a very serious matter to him. When I have heard such inconsiderate remarks made, I have usually put this question: Suppose you were in want of an additional workman, and two were to apply, both equally well qualified in other respects, but one had lost a thumb or a forefinger, which would you engage? There never was a hesitation as to the answer....” The manufacturers have “mistaken prejudices against what they have heard represented as a pseudo-philanthropic legislation.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1855."") These manufacturers are clever folk, and not without reason were they enthusiastic for the slave-holders’ rebellion.  ","Machinery

In those factories that have been longest subject to the Factory Acts, with their compulsory limitation of the hours of labour, and other regulations, many of the older abuses have vanished. The very improvement of the machinery demands to a certain extent “improved construction of the buildings,” and this is an advantage to the workpeople.

Sir James Steuart also understands machinery quite in this sense. “Je considère donc les machines comme des moyens d’augmenter (virtuellement) le nombre des gens industrieux qu’on n’est pas obligé de nourrir....

More naïve is Petty, who says, it replaces “Polygamy.” The above point of view is, at the most, admissible only for some parts of the United States. On the other hand, “machinery can seldom be used with success to abridge the labour of an individual; more time would be lost in its construction than could be saved by its application. It is only really useful when it acts on great masses, when a single machine can assist the work of thousands. It is accordingly in the most populous countries, where there are most idle men, that it is most abundant.... It is not called into use by a scarcity of men, but by the facility with which they can be brought to work in masses.” (Piercy Ravenstone: “Thoughts on the Funding System and its Effects.” London, 1824, p. 45.)

The competition between hand-weaving and power-weaving in England, before the passing of the Poor Law of 1833, was prolonged by supplementing the wages, which had fallen considerably below the minimum, with parish relief. “The Rev. Mr. Turner was, in 1827, rector of Wilmslow in Cheshire, a manufacturing district. The questions of the Committee of Emigration, and Mr. Turner’s answers, show how the competition of human labour is maintained against machinery. ‘Question: Has not the use of the power-loom superseded the use of the hand-loom? Answer: Undoubtedly; it would have superseded them much more than it has done, if the hand-loom weavers were not enabled to submit to a reduction of wages.’ ‘Question: But in submitting he has accepted wages which are insufficient to support him, and looks to parochial contribution as the remainder of his support? Answer: Yes, and in fact the competition between the hand-loom and the power-loom is maintained out of the poor-rates.’ Thus degrading pauperism or expatriation, is the benefit which the industrious receive from the introduction of machinery, to be reduced from the respectable and in some degree independent mechanic, to the cringing wretch who lives on the debasing bread of charity.

The rapid improvement of machinery, during the crisis, allowed the English manufacturers, immediately after the termination of the American Civil War, and almost in no time, to glut the markets of the world again. Cloth, during the last six months of 1866, was almost unsaleable. Thereupon began the consignment of goods to India and China, thus naturally making the glut more intense. At the beginning of 1867 the manufacturers resorted to their usual way out of the difficulty, viz., reducing wages 5 per cent. The workpeople resisted, and said that the only remedy was to work short time, 4 days a-week; and their theory was the correct one. After holding out for some time, the self-elected captains of industry had to make up their minds to short time, with reduced wages in some places, and in others without.  ","Machinery

Say, remarks on this point: “Where division of labour is well developed, the skill of the labourer is available only in that particular branch in which it has been acquired; he himself is a sort of machine. It does not therefore help matters one jot, to repeat in parrot fashion, that things have a tendency to find their level. On looking around us we cannot but see, that they are unable to find their level for a long time; and that when they do find it, the level is always lower than at the commencement of the process.” (“An Inquiry into those Principles Respecting the Nature of Demand,” &c., Lond. 1821, p. 72.)

Ganilh, on the contrary, considers the final result of the factory system to be an absolutely less number of operatives, at whose expense an increased number of “gens honnêtes” live and develop their well-known “perfectibilité perfectible.” Little as he understands the movement of production, at least he feels, that machinery must needs be a very fatal institution, if its introduction converts busy workmen into paupers, and its development calls more slaves of labour into existence than it has suppressed. It is not possible to bring out the cretinism of his standpoint, except by his own words: “Les classes condamnées à produire et à consommer diminuent, et les classes qui dirigent le travail, qui soulagent, consolent, et éclairent toute la population, se multiplient ... et s’approprient tous les bienfaits qui résultent de la diminution des frais du travail, de l’abondance des productions, et du bon marché des consommations.

In an appeal made in July, 1866, to the Trade Societies of England, by the shoemakers of Leicester, who had been thrown on the streets by a lock-out, it is stated: “Twenty years ago the Leicester shoe trade was revolutionised by the introduction of riveting in the place of stitching. At that time good wages could be earned. Great competition was shown between the different firms as to which could turn out the neatest article. Shortly afterwards, however a worse kind of competition sprang up, namely, that of underselling one another in the market. The injurious consequences soon manifested themselves in reductions of wages, and so sweepingly quick was the fall in the price of labour, that many firms now pay only one half of the original wages. And yet, though wages sink lower and lower, profits appear, with each alteration in the scale of wages, to increase.” Even bad times are utilised by the manufacturers, for making exceptional profits by excessive lowering of wages, i.e., by a direct robbery of the labourer’s means of subsistence. One example (it has reference to the crisis in the Coventry silk weaving): “From information I have received from manufacturers as well as workmen, there seems to be no doubt that wages have been reduced to a greater extent than either the competition of the foreign producers, or other circumstances have rendered necessary ... the majority of weavers are working at a reduction of 30 to 40 per cent. in their wages. A piece of ribbon for making which the weaver got 6s. or 7s. five years back, now only brings them 3s. 3d. or 3s. 6d.; other work is now priced at 2s. and 2s. 3d. which was formerly priced at 4s. and 4s. 3d. The reduction in wage seems to have been carried to a greater extent than is necessary for increasing demand. Indeed, the reduction in the cost of weaving, in the case of many descriptions of ribbons, has not been accompanied by any corresponding reduction in the selling price of the manufactured article.” (Mr. F. D. Longe’s Report. “Ch. Emp. Com., V. Rep., 1866,” p. 114, 1.)  ","Machinery

In an appeal, dated 1863, of the factory operatives of Lancashire, &c., for the purpose of forming a society for organised emigration, we find the following: “That a large emigration of factory workers is now absolutely essential to raise them from their present prostrate condition, few will deny; but to show that a continuous stream of emigration is at all times demanded, and, without which it is impossible for than to maintain their position in ordinary times, we beg to call attention to the subjoined facts: — In 1814 the official value of cotton goods exported was £17,665,378, whilst the real marketable value was £20,070,824. In 1858 the official value of cotton goods exported, was £182,221,681; but the real or marketable value was only £43,001,322, being a ten-fold quantity sold for little more than double the former price. To produce results so disadvantageous to the country generally, and to the factory workers in particular, several causes have cooperated, which, had circumstances permitted, we should have brought more prominently under your notice; suffice it for the present to say that the most obvious one is the constant redundancy of labour, without which a trade so ruinous in its effects never could have been carried on, and which requires a constantly extending market to save it from annihilation. Our cotton mills may be brought to a stand by the periodical stagnations of trade, which, under present arrangements, are as inevitable as death itself; but the human mind is constantly at work, and although we believe we are under the mark in stating that six millions of persons have left these shores during the last 25 years, yet, from the natural increase of population, and the displacement of labour to cheapen production, a large percentage of the male adults in the most prosperous times find it impossible to obtain work in factories on any conditions whatever.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., 30th April 1863,” pp. 51-52.)

It has been found out by experiment, that with each respiration of average intensity made by a healthy average individual, about 25 cubic inches of air are consumed, and that about 20 respirations are made in each minute. Hence the air inhaled in 24 hours by each individual is about 720,000 cubic inches, or 416 cubic feet. It is clear, however, that air which has been once breathed, can no longer serve for the same process until it has been purified in the great workshop of Nature.

How modern industry, when it has attained to a certain pitch, is capable, by the revolution it effects in the mode of production and in the social conditions of production, of also revolutionising people’s minds, is strikingly shown by a comparison of Senior’s speech in 1863, with his philippic against the Factory Act of 1833; or by a comparison, of the views of the congress above referred to, with the fact that in certain country districts of England poor parents are forbidden, on pain of death by starvation, to educate their children. Thus, e.g., Mr. Snell reports it to be a common occurrence in Somersetshire that, when a poor person claims parish relief, he is compelled to take his children from school.

Wherever handicraft-machines, driven by men, compete directly or indirectly with more developed machines driven by mechanical power, a great change takes place with regard to the labourer who drives the machine.

Consequently the tension and the amount of labour-power expended become monstrous, and especially so in the case of the children who are condemned to this torture. Thus Mr. Longe; one of the commissioners, found in Coventry and the neighbourhood boys of from 10 to 15 years employed in driving the ribbon-looms, not to mention younger children who had to drive smaller machines. “It is extraordinarily fatiguing work.

With all its defects this Act, together with the Swiss Federal Factory Law of March 23, 1877, is still by far the best piece of legislation in this field. A comparison of it with the said Swiss federal law is of particular interest because it clearly demonstrates the merits and demerits of the two legislative methods — the English, “historical” method, which intervenes when occasion requires, and the continental method, which is built up on the traditions of the French Revolution and generalises more. Unfortunately, due to insufficient inspection personnel, the English code is still largely a dead letter with regard to its application to workshops. — F. E.] ","Machinery

Auflage, 1862, and especially the “Einleitung in die Naturgesetze des Feldbaus,” in the 1st Volume. To have developed from the point of view of natural science, the negative, i.e., destructive side of modern agriculture, is one of Liebig’s immortal merits. His summary, too, of the history of agriculture, although not free from gross errors, contains flashes of light. It is, however, to be regretted that he ventures on such haphazard assertions as the following: “By greater pulverising and more frequent ploughing, the circulation of air in the interior of porous soil is aided, and the surface exposed to the action of the atmosphere is increased and renewed; but it is easily seen that the increased yield of the land cannot be proportional to the labour spent on that land, but increases in a much smaller proportion. This law,” adds Liebig, “was first enunciated by John Stuart Mill in his ‘Principles of Pol. Econ.,’ Vol. 1, p. 17, as follows: ‘That the produce of land increases, caeteris paribus, in a diminishing ratio to the increase of the labourers employed’ (Mill here introduces in an erroneous form the law enunciated by Ricardo’s school, for since the ‘decrease of the labourers employed,’ kept even pace in England with the advance of agriculture, the law discovered in, and applied to, England, could have no application to that country, at all events), ‘is the universal law of agricultural industry.’ This is very remarkable, since Mill was ignorant of the reason for this law.”  (Liebig, l.c., Bd. I., p. 143 and Note.) Apart from Liebig’s wrong interpretation of the word “labour,” by which word he understands something quite different from what Political Economy does, it is, in any case, “very remarkable” that he should make Mr. John Stuart Mill the first propounder of a theory which was first published by James Anderson in A. Smith’s days, and was repeated in various works down to the beginning of the 19th century; a theory which Malthus, that master in plagiarism (the whole of his population theory is a shameless plagiarism), appropriated to himself in 1815; which West developed at the same time as, and independently of, Anderson; which in the year 1817 was connected by Ricardo with the general theory of value, then made the round of the world as Ricardo’s theory, and in 1820 was vulgarised by James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill; and which, finally, was reproduced by John Stuart Mill and others, as a dogma already quite commonplace, and known to every schoolboy. It cannot be denied that John Stuart Mill owes his, at all events, “remarkable” authority almost entirely to such quid-pro-quos. ","Machinery

2134,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"In considering the labour-process, we began (see Chapter  VII.) by treating it in the abstract, apart from its historical forms,  as a process between man and Nature. We there stated, “If we examine the  whole labour-process, from the point of view of its result, it is plain  that both the instruments and the subject of labour are means of production,  and that the labour itself is productive labour.” And in Note 2, same page,  we further added: “This method of determining, from the standpoint of the  labour-process alone, what is productive labour, is by no means directly  applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production.” We now  proceed to the further development of this subject.","Absolute
and Relative Surplus-Value"
2135,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"So far as the labour-process is purely individual, one and the  same labourer unites in himself all the functions, that later on become  separated. When an individual appropriates natural objects for his livelihood,  no one controls him but himself. Afterwards he is controlled by others.  A single man cannot operate upon Nature without calling his own muscles  into play under the control of his own brain. As in the natural body head  and hand wait upon each other, so the labour-process unites the labour  of the hand with that of the head. Later on they part company and even  become deadly foes. The product ceases to be the direct product of the  individual, and becomes a social product, produced in common by a collective  labourer, i.e., by a combination of workmen, each of whom takes  only a part, greater or less, in the manipulation of the subject of their  labour. As the co-operative character of the labour-process becomes more  and more marked, so, as a necessary consequence, does our notion of productive  labour, and of its agent the productive labourer, become extended. In order  to labour productively, it is no longer necessary for you to do manual  work yourself; enough, if you are an organ of the collective labourer,  and perform one of its subordinate functions. The first definition given  above of productive labour, a definition deduced from the very nature of  the production of material objects, still remains correct for the collective  labourer, considered as a whole. But it no longer holds good for each member  taken individually. ","Absolute
and Relative Surplus-Value"
2136,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"On the other hand, however, our notion of productive labour becomes  narrowed. Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities,  it is essentially the production of surplus-value. The labourer produces,  not for himself, but for capital. It no longer suffices, therefore, that  he should simply produce. He must produce surplus-value. That labourer  alone is productive, who produces surplus-value for the capitalist, and  thus works for the self-expansion of capital. If we may take an example  from outside the sphere of production of material objects, a schoolmaster  is a productive labourer when, in addition to belabouring the heads of  his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That  the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in  a sausage factory, does not alter the relation. Hence the notion of a productive  labourer implies not merely a relation between work and useful effect,  between labourer and product of labour, but also a specific, social relation  of production, a relation that has sprung up historically and stamps the  labourer as the direct means of creating surplus-value. To be a productive  labourer is, therefore, not a piece of luck, but a misfortune. In Book  IV. which treats of the history of the theory, it will be more clearly  seen, that the production of surplus-value has at all times been made,  by classical political economists, the distinguishing characteristic of  the productive labourer. Hence their definition of a productive labourer  changes with their comprehension of the nature of surplus-value. Thus the  Physiocrats insist that only agricultural labour is productive, since that  alone, they say, yields a surplus-value. And they say so because, with  them, surplus-value has no existence except in the form of rent.","Absolute
and Relative Surplus-Value"
2137,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"The prolongation of the working-day beyond the point at which  the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his  labour-power, and the appropriation of that surplus-labour by capital,  this is production of absolute surplus-value. It forms the general groundwork  of the capitalist system, and the starting-point for the production of  relative surplus-value. The latter presupposes that the working-day is  already divided into two parts, necessary labour, and surplus-labour. In  order to prolong the surplus-labour, the necessary labour is shortened  by methods whereby the equivalent for the wages is produced in less time.  The production of absolute surplus-value turns exclusively upon the length  of the working-day; the production of relative surplus-value, revolutionises  out and out the technical processes of labour, and the composition of society.  It therefore presupposes a specific mode, the capitalist mode of production,  a mode which, along with its methods, means, and conditions, arises and  develops itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal  subjection of labour to capital. In the course of this development, the  formal subjection is replaced by the real subjection of labour to capital.","Absolute
and Relative Surplus-Value"
2138,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"It will suffice merely to refer to certain intermediate forms,  in which surplus-labour is not extorted by direct compulsion from the producer,  nor the producer himself yet formally subjected to capital. In such forms  capital has not yet acquired the direct control of the labour-process.  By the side of independent producers who carry on their handicrafts and  agriculture in the traditional old-fashioned way, there stands the usurer  or the merchant, with his usurer’s capital or merchant’s capital, feeding  on them like a parasite. The predominance, in a society, of this form of  exploitation excludes the capitalist mode of production; to which mode,  however, this form may serve as a transition, as it did towards the close  of the Middle Ages. Finally, as is shown by modern “domestic industry,”   some intermediate forms are here and there reproduced in the background  of Modern Industry, though their physiognomy is totally changed.","Absolute
and Relative Surplus-Value"
2139,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"If, on the one hand, the mere formal subjection of labour to capital  suffices for the production of absolute surplus-value, if, e.g.,  it is sufficient that handicraftsmen who previously worked on their own  account, or as apprentices of a master, should become wage labourers under  the direct control of a capitalist; so, on the other hand, we have seen,  how the methods of producing relative surplus-value, are, at the same time,  methods of producing absolute surplus-value. Nay, more, the excessive prolongation  of the working-day turned out to be the peculiar product of Modern Industry.  Generally speaking, the specifically capitalist mode of production ceases  to be a mere means of producing relative surplus-value, so soon as that  mode has conquered an entire branch of production; and still more so, so  soon as it has conquered all the important branches. It then becomes the  general, socially predominant form of production. As a special method of  producing relative surplus-value, it remains effective only, first, in  so far as it seizes upon industries that previously were only formally  subject to capital, that is, so far as it is propagandist; secondly, in  so far as the industries that have been taken over by it, continue to be  revolutionised by changes in the methods of production.","Absolute
and Relative Surplus-Value"
2140,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"From one standpoint, any distinction between absolute and relative  surplus-value appears illusory. Relative surplus-value is absolute, since  it compels the absolute prolongation of the working-day beyond the labour-time  necessary to the existence of the labourer himself. Absolute surplus-value  is relative, since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness  of labour, as will allow of the necessary labour-time being confined to  a portion of the working-day. But if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplus-value,  this appearance of identity vanishes. Once the capitalist mode of production  is established and become general, the difference between absolute and  relative surplus-value makes itself felt, whenever there is a question  of raising the rate of surplus-value. Assuming that labour-power is paid  for at its value, we are confronted by this alternative: given the productiveness  of labour and its normal intensity, the rate of surplus-value can be raised  only by the actual prolongation of the working-day; on the other hand,  given the length of the working-day, that rise can be effected only by  a change in the relative magnitudes of the components of the working-day,  viz., necessary labour and surplus-labour; a change which, if the wages  are not to fall below the value of labour-power, presupposes a change either  in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour.

2141,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch16.htm,"If the labourer wants all his time to produce the necessary means  of subsistence for himself and his race, he has no time left in which to  work gratis for others. Without a certain degree of productiveness in his  labour, he has no such superfluous time at his disposal; without such superfluous  time, no surplus-labour, and therefore no capitalists, no slave-owners,  no feudal lords, in one word, no class of large proprietors.

Besides, capital with its accompanying relations springs up from an economic soil that is the product of a long process of development. The productiveness  of labour that serves as its foundation and starting-point, is a gift,  not of nature, but of a history embracing thousands of centuries.","Absolute

These are all referable to the constitution of man  himself (race, &c.), and to surrounding nature. The external physical  conditions fall into two great economic classes, (1) Natural wealth in  means of subsistence, i.e., a fruitful soil, waters teeming with  fish, &c., and (2), natural wealth in the instruments of labour, such  as waterfalls, navigable rivers, wood, metal, coal, &c. At the dawn  of civilisation, it is the first class that turns the scale; at a higher  stage of development, it is the second.

Most of the children go without  shoes and unclothed, for the air is so mild. Hence a child, until he is  grown up, costs his parents not more, on the whole, than twenty drachmas.

Just as the individual labourer can do more surplus-labour  in proportion as his necessary labour-time is less, so with regard to the  working population.

The bounty of Nature does not explain  why he would then have to work 6 days a week, or why he must furnish 5  days of surplus-labour.

On the other hand, his school has openly proclaimed the productiveness  of labour to be the originating cause of profit (read: Surplus-value).  This at all events is a progress as against the mercantilists who, on their  side, derived the excess of the price over the cost of production of the  product, from the act of exchange, from the product being sold above its  value. Nevertheless, Ricardo’s school simply shirked the problem, they  did not solve it. In fact these bourgeois economists instinctively saw,  and rightly so, that it is very dangerous to stir too deeply the burning  question of the origin of surplus-value.

On the other hand, it is absolutely false to say that “profits will be  20%.” They will always be less, because they are calculated upon the sum  total of the capital advanced.

It is self-evident, that if a constant quantity consists  of two parts, neither of them can increase without the other diminishing.  Let the two parts at starting be equal; 3 shillings value of labour-power,  3 shillings surplus-value. Then the value of the labour-power cannot rise  from three shillings to four, without the surplus-value falling from three  shillings to two; and the surplus-value cannot rise from three shillings  to four, without the value of labour-power falling from three shillings  to two. Under these circumstances, therefore, no change can take place  in the absolute magnitude, either of the surplus-value, or of the value  of labour-power, without a simultaneous change in their relative magnitudes,  i.e., relatively to each other.

On the other hand, the value  of the labour-power cannot rise from three shillings to four, without a  decrease in the productiveness of labour, whereby eight hours become requisite  to produce the same quantity of necessaries, for the production of which  six hours previously sufficed. It follows from this, that an increase in  the productiveness of labour causes a fall in the value of labour-power  and a consequent rise in surplus-value, while, on the other hand, a decrease  in such productiveness causes a rise in the value of labour-power, and  a fall in surplus-value.

They do increase or diminish  by the same quantity. But their proportional increase or diminution depends  on their original magnitudes before the change in the productiveness of  labour took place. If the value of the labour-power be 4 shillings, or  the necessary labour time 8 hours, and the surplus-value be 2 shillings,  or the surplus-labour 4 hours, and if, in consequence of an increase in  the productiveness of labour, the value of the labour-power fall to 3 shillings,  or the necessary labour to 6 hours, the surplus-value will rise to 3 shillings,  or the surplus-labour to 6 hours. The same quantity, 1 shilling or 2 hours,  is added in one case and subtracted in the other. But the proportional  change of magnitude is different in each case. While the value of the labour-power  falls from 4 shillings to 3, i.e., by 1/4 or 25%, the surplus-value  rises from 2 shillings to 3, i.e., by 1/2 or 50%. It therefore follows  that the proportional increase or diminution in surplus-value, consequent  on a given change in the productiveness of labour, depends on the original  magnitude of that portion of the working day which embodies itself in surplus-value;  the smaller that portion, the greater is the proportional change; the greater  that portion, the less is the proportional change.

If, then, as we have already seen, there can be no change of absolute magnitude  in the value of labour-power, and in surplus-value, unaccompanied by a  change in their relative magnitudes, so now it follows that no change in  their relative magnitudes is possible, without a previous change in the  absolute magnitude of the value of labour-power.

The limit  of this change is given by the altered value of labour-power. Nevertheless,  even when circumstances allow the law to operate, subsidiary movements  may occur. For example: if in consequence of the increased productiveness  of labour, the value of labour-power falls from 4 shillings to 3, or the  necessary labour time from 8 hours to 6, the price of labour-power may  possibly not fall below 3s. 8d., 3s. 6d., or 3s. 2d., and the surplus-value  consequently not rise above 3s. 4d., 3s. 6d., or 3s. 10d.

It is, however, possible  that, owing to an increase of productiveness, both the labourer and the  capitalist may simultaneously be able to appropriate a greater quantity  of these necessaries, without any change in the price of labour-power or  in surplus-value. If the value of labour-power be 3 shillings, and the  necessary labour time amount to 6 hours, if the surplus-value likewise  be 3 shillings, and the surplus-labour 6 hours, then if the productiveness  of labour were doubled without altering the ratio of necessary labour to  surplus-labour, there would be no change of magnitude in surplus-value  and price of labour-power. The only result would be that each of them would  represent twice as many use-values as before; these use-values being twice  as cheap as before. Although labour-power would be unchanged in price,  it would be above its value. If, however, the price of labour-power had  fallen, not to 1s. 6d., the lowest possible point consistent with its new  value, but to 2s. 10d. or 2s. 6d., still this lower price would represent  an increased mass of necessaries. In this way it is possible with an increasing  productiveness of labour, for the price of labour-power to keep on falling,  and yet this fall to be accompanied by a constant growth in the mass of  the labourer's means of subsistence. But even in such case, the fall in  the value of labour-power would cause a corresponding rise of surplus-value,  and thus the abyss between the labourer's position and that of the capitalist  would keep widening.

But he falls into the following errors: (1) he looks  upon the special conditions under which these laws hold good as the general  and sole conditions of capitalist production. He knows no change, either  in the length of the working-day, or in the intensity of labour; consequently  with him there can be only one variable factor, viz., the productiveness  of labour; (2), and this error vitiates his analysis much more than (1),  he has not, any more than have the other economists, investigated surplus-value  as such, i.e., independently of its particular forms, such as profit,  rent, &c. He therefore confounds together the laws of the rate of surplus-value  and the laws of the rate of profit. The rate of profit is, as we have already  said, the ratio of the surplus-value to the total capital advanced; the  rate of surplus-value is the ratio of the surplus-value to the variable  part of that capital. Assume that a capital C of £500 is made up  of raw material, instruments of labour, &c. (c) to the amount of £400;  and of wages (v) to the amount of £100; and further, that the surplus-value  (s) = £100. Then we have rate of surplus-value s/v = £100/£100  = 100%. But the rate of profit s/c = £100/£500 = 20%. It is,  besides, obvious that the rate of profit may depend on circumstances that  in no way affect the rate of surplus-value.

Hence a working-day of more intense labour is  embodied in more products than is one of less intense labour, the length  of each day being the same. Increased productiveness of labour also, it  is true, will supply more products in a given working-day. But in this  latter case, the value of each single product falls, for it costs less  labour than before; in the former case, that value remains unchanged, for  each article costs the same labour as before. Here we have an increase  in the number of products, unaccompanied by a fall in their individual  prices: as their number increases, so does the sum of their prices. But  in the case of increased productiveness, a given value is spread over a  greater mass of products. Hence the length of the working-day being constant,  a day's labour of increased intensity will be incorporated in an increased  value, and, the value of money remaining unchanged, in more money. The  value created varies with the extent to which the intensity of labour deviates  from its normal intensity in the society. A given working-day, therefore,  no longer creates a constant, but a variable value; in a day of 12 hours  of ordinary intensity, the value created is, say 6 shillings, but with  increased intensity, the value created may be 7, 8, or more shillings.  It is clear that, if the value created by a day's labour increases from,  say, 6 to 8 shillings then the two parts into which this value is divided,  viz., price of labour-power and surplus-value, may both of them increase  simultaneously, and either equally or unequally. They may both simultaneously  increase from 3 shillings to 4. Here, the rise in the price of labour-power  does not necessarily imply that the price has risen above the value of  labour-power.

With regard to the unusual exertions made by the labouring classes in periods  of dearness, which produce the fall of wages noticed in the evidence” (namely,  before the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry, 1814-15), “they are most  meritorious in the individuals, and certainly favour the growth of capital.  But no man of humanity could wish to see them constant and unremitted.  They are most admirable as a temporary relief; but if they were constantly  in action, effects of a similar kind would result from them, as from the  population of a country being pushed to the very extreme limits of its  food.” (Malthus: “Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent,” Lond.,  1815, p. 48, note.)

But the conservative interests, which Malthus served,  prevented him from seeing that an unlimited prolongation of the working-day,  combined with an extraordinary development of machinery, and the exploitation  of women and children, must inevitably have made a great portion of the  working-class “supernumerary,” particularly whenever the war should have  ceased, and the monopoly of England in the markets of the world should  have come to an end. It was, of course, far more convenient, and much more  in conformity with the interests of the ruling classes, whom Malthus adored  like a true priest, to explain this “over-population” by the eternal laws  of Nature, rather than by the historical laws of capitalist production.","Changes

The working-day of 12 hours embodies itself, e.g., in a  money-value of 6s. Either equivalents are exchanged, and then the labourer  receives 6s, for 12 hours’ labour; the price of his labour would be equal  to the price of his product. In this case he produces no surplus-value  for the buyer of his labour, the 6s. are not transformed into capital,  the basis of capitalist production vanishes. But it is on this very basis  that he sells his labour and that his labour is wage-labour. Or else he  receives for 12 hours’ labour less than 6s., i.e., less than 12 hours’  labour. Twelve hours’ labour are exchanged against 10, 6, &c., hours’  labour. This equalization of unequal quantities not merely does away with  the determination of value.

A commodity represents, say, 6 working-hours. If an invention is made by  which it can be produced in 3 hours, the value, even of the commodity already  produced, falls by half.

That in their appearance  things often represent themselves in inverted form is pretty well known  in every science except Political Economy.  ",The Transformation of the Value (and Respective Price) of Labour-Power into Wages
2293,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch19.htm,"Classical Political Economy borrowed from every-day life the category   “price of labour” without further criticism, and then simply asked the  question, how is this price determined? It soon recognized that the change  in the relations of demand and supply explained in regard to the price  of labour, as of all other commodities, nothing except its changes i.e.,  the oscillations of the market-price above or below a certain mean. If  demand and supply balance, the oscillation of prices ceases, all other  conditions remaining the same. But then demand and supply also cease to  explain anything. The price of labour, at the moment when demand and supply  are in equilibrium, is its natural price, determined independently of the  relation of demand and supply. And how this price is determined is just  the question. Or a larger period of oscillations in the market-price is  taken, e.g., a year, and they are found to cancel one the other, leaving  a mean average quantity, a relatively constant magnitude. This had naturally  to be determined otherwise than by its own compensating variations. This  price which always finally predominates over the accidental market-prices  of labour and regulates them, this “necessary price” (Physiocrats) or “natural  price” of labour (Adam Smith) can, as with all other commodities, be nothing  else than its value expressed in money. In this way Political Economy expected  to penetrate athwart the accidental prices of labour, to the value of labour.  As with other commodities, this value was determined by the cost of production.  But what is the cost of production – of the labourer, i.e., the cost of producing  or reproducing the labourer himself? This question unconsciously substituted  itself in Political Economy for the original one; for the search after  the cost of production of labour as such turned in a circle and never left  the spot. What economists therefore call value of labour, is in fact the  value of labour-power, as it exists in the personality of the labourer,  which is as different from its function, labour, as a machine is from the  work it performs. Occupied with the difference between the market-price  of labour and its so-called value, with the relation of this value to the  rate of profit, and to the values of the commodities produced by means  of labour, &c., they never discovered that the course of the analysis  had led not only from the market-prices of labour to its presumed value,  but had led to the resolution of this value of labour itself into the value  of labour-power. Classical economy never arrived at a consciousness of  the results of its own analysis; it accepted uncritically the categories   “value of labour,” “natural price of labour,” &c., as final and as  adequate expressions for the value-relation under consideration, and was  thus led, as will be seen later, into inextricable confusion and contradiction,  while it offered to the vulgar economists a secure basis of operations  for their shallowness, which on principle worships appearances only.

If the labourer receives 3s., then he  receives the value of his labour-power functioning through 12 hours. If,  now, this value of a day’s labour-power is expressed as the value of a  day’s labour itself, we have the formula: Twelve hours’ labour has a value  of 3s. The value of labour-power thus determines the value of labour, or,  expressed in money, its necessary price.

In the above example, the value of the labour-power that  functions through 12 hours is 3s., a value for the reproduction of which  6 hours are required. The value which the labour-power produces is, on  the other hand, 6s., because it, in fact, functions during 12 hours, and  the value it produces depends, not on its own value, but on the length  of time it is in action.

The wage form thus extinguishes every trace of the division  of the working-day into necessary labour and surplus-labour, into paid  and unpaid labour. All labour appears as paid labour. In the corvée,  the labour of the worker for himself, and his compulsory labour for his  lord, differ in space and time in the clearest possible way. In slave labour,  even that part of the working-day in which the slave is only replacing  the value of his own means of existence, in which, therefore, in fact,  he works for himself alone, appears as labour for his master. All the slave’s  labour appears as unpaid labour.  In wage labour,  on the contrary, even surplus-labour, or unpaid labour, appears as paid.

One might as well conclude that not the value of a machine is paid, but  that of its working, because it costs more to hire a machine for a week  than for a day. 2.)

Hence, in answer to Proudhon’s phrase; “Labour is called  value, not as being a commodity itself, but in view of the values supposed  to be potentially embodied in it. The value of labour is a figurative expression,”   &c. I have remarked: “In labour, commodity, which is a frightful reality,  he (Proudhon) sees nothing but a grammatical ellipsis. The whole of existing  society, then, based upon labour commodity, is henceforth based upon a  poetic license, on a figurative expression. Does society desire to eliminate  all the inconveniences which trouble it, it has only to eliminate all the  ill-sounding terms. Let it change the language, and for that it has only  to address itself to the Academy and ask it for a new edition of its dictionary.”   ( “Misère de la Philosophie,” pp. 34, 35.) It is naturally still  more convenient to understand by value nothing at all. Then one can without  difficulty subsume everything under this category. Thus, e.g., J. B. Say:   “What is value?” Answer: “That which a thing is worth""; and what is “price""?  Answer: “The value of a thing expressed in money.” And why has agriculture  a value? Answer: “Because one sets a price on it.” Therefore value is what  a thing is worth, and the land has its “value,” because its value is “expressed  in money.” This is, anyhow, a very simple way of explaining the why and  the wherefore of things.",The Transformation of the Value (and Respective Price) of Labour-Power into Wages

An exposition of all these forms however, belongs to the special study  of wage labour, not therefore to this work. Still the two fundamental forms  must be briefly worked out here.  ",Time-Wages

Similarly the distinction between the exchange-value of labour power, and  the sum of the necessaries of life into which this value is converted,  now reappears as the distinction between nominal and real wages. It would  be useless to repeat here, with regard to the phenomenal form, what has  been already worked out in the substantial form. We limit ourselves therefore  to a few points characteristic of time-wages.     ",Time-Wages

How then, to find this price, i.e., the money-value  of a given quantity of labour? The average price of labour is found, when  the average daily value of the labour-power is divided by the average number  of hours in the working-day. If, e.g., the daily value of labour-power  is 3 shillings, the value of the product of 6 working-hours, and if the  working-day is 12 hours, the price of 1 working hour is 3/12 shillings  = 3d. The price of the working-hour thus found serves as the unit measure  for the price of labour.     ",Time-Wages
2327,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch20.htm,"It follows therefore that the daily and weekly wages, &c.,  may remain the same, although the price of labour falls constantly. If,  e.g., the habitual working-day is 10 hours and the daily value of the labour-power  3s., the price of the working-hour is 3 3/5d. It falls to 3d. as soon as  the working-day rises to 12 hours, to 2 2/5d as soon as it rises to 15  hours. Daily or weekly wages remain, despite all this, unchanged. On the  contrary, the daily or weekly wages may rise, although the price of labour  remains constant or even falls. If, e.g., the working-day is 10 hours,  and the daily value of labour-power 3 shillings, the price of one working-hour  is 3 3/5d. If the labourer, in consequence of increase of trade, works  12 hours, the price of labour remaining the same, his daily wage now rises  to 3 shillings 7 1/5 d. without any variation in the price of labour. The  same result might follow if, instead of the extensive amount of labour,  its intensive amount increased.  ",Time-Wages

2329,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch20.htm,"The unit-measure for time-wages, the price of the working-hour,  is the quotient of the value of a day’s labour-power, divided by the number  of hours of the average working-day. Let the latter be 12 hours, and the  daily value of labour-power 3 shillings, the value of the product of 6  hours of labour. Under these circumstances the price of a working hour  is 3d.; the value produced in it is 6d. If the labourer is now employed  less than 12 hours (or less than 6 days in the week), e.g., only 6 or 8  hours, he receives, with this price of labour, only 2s. or 1s. 6d. a day.   As on our hypothesis he must work on the average  6 hours daily, in order to produce a day’s wage corresponding merely to  the value of his labour power, as according to the same hypothesis he works  only half of every hour for himself, and half for the capitalist, it is  clear that he cannot obtain for himself the value of the product of 6 hours  if he is employed less than 12 hours. In previous chapters we saw the destructive  consequences of over-work; here we find the sources of the sufferings that  result to the labourer from his insufficient employment.  ",Time-Wages

The connection between the paid and the unpaid  labour is destroyed. The capitalist can now wring from the labour a certain  quantity of surplus-labour without allowing him the labour-time necessary  for his own subsistence. He can annihilate all regularity of employment,  and according to his own convenience, caprice, and the interest of the  moment, make the most enormous overwork alternate with relative or absolute  cessation of work. He can, under the pretense of paying “the normal price  of labour,” abnormally lengthen the working-day without any corresponding  compensation to the labourer. Hence the perfectly rational revolt in 1860  of the London labourers, employed in the building trades, against the attempt  of the capitalists to impose on them this sort of wage by the hour. The  legal limitation of the working-day puts an end to such mischief, although  not, of course, to the diminution of employment caused by the competition  of machinery, by changes in the quality of the labourers employed, and  by crises partial or general.

The  value of labour-power, as dependent on its wear and tear, increases with  the duration of its functioning, and in more rapid proportion than the  increase of that duration. In many branches of industry where time-wage  is the general rule without legal limits to the working-time, the habit  has, therefore, spontaneously grown up of regarding the working day as  normal only up to a certain point, e.g., up to the expiration of the tenth  hour (“normal working-day,” “the day’s work,” “the regular hours of work”).  Beyond this limit the working-time is over-time, and is, taking the hour  as unit-measure, paid better (“extra pay”), although often in a proportion  ridiculously small.   ",Time-Wages

But the same circumstances which allow the  capitalist in the long run to prolong the working-day, also allow him first,  and compel him finally, to nominally lower the price of labour until the  total price of the increased number of hours is lowered, and, therefore,  the daily or weekly wage. Reference to two circumstances is sufficient  here. If one man does the work of 1½ or 2 men, the supply of labour  increases, although the supply of labour-power on the market remains constant.  The competition thus created between the labourers allows the capitalist  to beat down the price of labour, whilst the falling price of labour allows  him, on the other hand, to screw up still further the working-time.  ",Time-Wages
2339,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch20.htm,"This jeremiad is also interesting because it shows how the appearance  only of the relations of production mirrors itself in the brain of the  capitalist. The capitalist does not know that the normal price of labour  also includes a definite quantity of unpaid labour, and that this very  unpaid labour is the normal source of his gain. The category of surplus  labour-time does not exist at all for him, since it is included in the  normal working-day, which he thinks he has paid for in the day’s wages.  But over-time does exist for him, the prolongation of the working-day beyond  the limits corresponding with the usual price of labour. Face to face with  his underselling competitor, he even insists upon extra pay for this over-time.  He again does not know that this extra pay includes unpaid labour, just  as well as does the price of the customary hour of labour. For example,  the price of one hour of the 12 hours’ working-day is 3d., say the value-product  of half a working-hour, whilst the price of the over-time working-hour  is 4d., or the value-product of 2/3 of a working hour.

Just as, with  time-wages, it does not matter whether we assume that the labourer works  6 hours for himself and 6 hours for the capitalist, or half of every hour  for himself, and the other half for the capitalist, so here it does not  matter whether we say that each individual piece is half paid, and half  unpaid for, or that the price of 12 pieces is the equivalent only of the  value of the labour-power, whilst in the other 12 pieces surplus-value  is incorporated.    ",Piece-Wages
2369,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"The form of piece wages is just as irrational as that of time-wages.  Whilst in our example two pieces of a commodity, after subtraction of the  value of the means of production consumed in them, are worth 6d. as being  the product of one hour, the labourer receives for them a price of 3d.  Piece wages do not, in fact, distinctly express any relation of value.  It is not, therefore, a question of measuring the value of the piece by  the working-time incorporated in it, but on the contrary, of measuring  the working-time the labourer has expended by the number of pieces he has  produced. In time-wages, the labour is measured by its immediate duration;  in piece wages, by the quantity of products in which the labour has embodied  itself during a given time.  The price of labour time itself is finally determined by the equation: value of a day’s labour = daily value of labour-power. Piece-wage is, therefore, only a modified  form of time-wage.  ",Piece-Wages
2370,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,Let us now consider a little more closely the characteristic peculiarities  of piece wages.  ,Piece-Wages
2371,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"The quality of the labour is here controlled by the work itself,  which must be of average perfection if the piece-price is to be paid in  full. Piece wages become, from this point of view, the most fruitful source  of reductions of wages and capitalistic cheating.    ",Piece-Wages
2372,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"They furnish to the capitalist an exact measure for the intensity  of labour. Only the working-time which is embodied in a quantum of commodities  determined beforehand, and experimentally fixed, counts as socially necessary  working-time, and is paid as such. In the larger workshops of the London  tailors, therefore, a certain piece of work, a waistcoat, e.g., is called  an hour, or half an hour, the hour at 6d. By practice it is known how much  is the average product of one hour. With new fashions, repairs, &c.,  a contest arises between master and labourer as to whether a particular  piece of work is one hour, and so on, until here also experience decides.  Similarly in the London furniture workshops, &c. If the labourer does  not possess the average capacity, if he cannot in consequence supply a  certain minimum of work per day, he is dismissed.   ",Piece-Wages
2373,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"Since the quality and intensity of the work are here controlled  by the form of wage itself, superintendence of labour becomes in great  part superfluous. Piece wages therefore lay the foundation of the modern   “domestic labour,” described above, as well as of a hierarchically organized  system of exploitation and oppression. The latter has two fundamental forms.  On the one hand, piece wages facilitate the interposition of parasites  between the capitalist and the wage-labourer, the “sub-letting of labour.”   The gain of these middlemen comes entirely from the difference between  the labour-price which the capitalist pays, and the part of that price  which they actually allow to reach the labourer.   ",Piece-Wages
2374,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"Given piece-wage, it is naturally the personal interest of the  labourer to strain his labour-power as intensely as possible; this enables  the capitalist to raise more easily the normal degree of intensity of labour.   This gradually brings on a reaction like that already described in time-wages, without reckoning that the prolongation of the  working-day, even if the piece wage remains constant, includes of necessity  a fall in the price of the labour.    ",Piece-Wages
2375,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"In time-wages, with few exceptions, the same wage holds for the  same kind of work, whilst in piece wages, though the price of the working  time is measured by a certain quantity of product, the day’s or week’s  wage will vary with the individual differences of the labourers, of whom  one supplies in a given time the minimum of product only, another the average,  a third more than the average. With regard to actual receipts there is,  therefore, great variety according to the different skill, strength, energy,  staying-power, &c., of the individual labourers.  ",Piece-Wages
2376,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"From what has been shown so far, it follows that piece-wage is  the form of wages most in harmony with the capitalist mode of production.  Although by no means new — it figures side by side with time-wages officially  in the French and English labour statutes of the 14th century — it only  conquers a larger field for action during the period of manufacture, properly  so-called. In the stormy youth of modern industry, especially from 1797  to 1815, it served as a lever for the lengthening of the working-day, and  the lowering of wages. Very important materials for the fluctuation of  wages during that period are to be found in the Blue books: “Report and  Evidence from the Select Committee on Petitions respecting the Corn Laws”   (Parliamentary Session of 1813-14), and “Report from the Lords’ Committee,  on the State of the Growth, Commerce, and Consumption of Grain, and all  Laws relating thereto” (Session of 1814-15). Here we find documentary evidence  of the constant lowering of the price of labour from the beginning of the  anti-Jacobin War. In the weaving industry, e.g., piece wages had fallen  so low that, in spite of the very great lengthening of the working-day,  the daily wages were then lower than before.",Piece-Wages

Their weekly wages are about 12s., and although it may be assumed that a man earns on piece-work under the greater stimulus  to labour, 1s. or perhaps 2s. more than on weekly wages, yet it is found,  on calculating his total income, that his loss of employment, during the  year, outweighs this gain...Further, it will generally be found that the  wages of these men bear a certain proportion to the price of the necessary  means of subsistence, so that a man with two children is able to bring  up his family without recourse to parish relief.” ",Piece-Wages

2382,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"In the workshops under the Factory Acts, piece wages become the  general rule, because capital can there only increase the efficacy of the  working-day by intensifying labour.  ",Piece-Wages
2383,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch21.htm,"With the changing productiveness of labour the same quantum of  product represents a varying working-time. Therefore, piece-wage also varies,  for it is the money expression of a determined working-time. In our example  above, 24 pieces were produced in 12 hours, whilst the value of the product  of the 12 hours was 6s., the daily value of the labour-power 3s., the price  of the labour-hour 3d., and the wage for one piece ½d. In one piece half-an-hour’s  labour was absorbed. If the same working-day now supplies, in consequence  of the doubled productiveness of labour, 48 pieces instead of 24, and all  other circumstances remain unchanged, then the piece-wage falls from 1  ½d. to 3/4d., as every piece now only represents 1/4, instead of ½  of a working-hour. 24 by 1½d. = 3s., and in like manner 48 by 3/4d.  = 3s. In other words, piece-wage is lowered in the same proportion as the  number of the pieces produced in the same time rises,  and, therefore, as the working time spent on the same piece falls. This change in piece-wage, so far purely nominal, leads to constant battles  between capitalist and labour. Either because the capitalist uses it as  a pretext for actually lowering the price of labour, or because increased  productive power of labour is accompanied by an increased intensity of  the same. Or because the labourer takes seriously the appearance of piece wages  (viz., that his product is paid for, and not his labour-power) and therefore  revolts against a lowering of wages, unaccompanied by a lowering in the  selling price of the commodity.",Piece-Wages

As has been already said, the simple translation of the value, or respectively of the price, of labour-power into the exoteric form of wages transforms all these laws into laws of the fluctuations of wages. That which appears in these fluctuations of wages within a single country as a series of varying combinations, may appear in different countries as contemporaneous difference of national wages. In the comparison of the wages in different nations, we must therefore take into account all the factors that determine changes in the amount of the value of labour-power; the price and the extent of the prime necessaries of life as naturally and historically developed, the cost of training the labourers, the part played by the labour of women and children, the productiveness of labour, its extensive and intensive magnitude. Even the most superficial comparison requires the reduction first of the average day-wage for the same trades, in different countries, to a uniform working-day. After this reduction to the same terms of the day-wages, time-wage must again be translated into piece-wage, as the latter only can be a measure both of the productivity and the intensity of labour.

Only a degree of intensity above the national average affects, in a given country, the measure of value by the mere duration of the working-time. This is not the case on the universal market, whose integral parts are the individual countries. The average intensity of labour changes from country to country; here it is greater, there less. These national averages form a scale, whose unit of measure is the average unit of universal labour. The more intense national labour, therefore, as compared with the less intense, produces in the same time more value, which expresses itself in more money. ","National

The relative value of money will, therefore, be less in the nation with more developed capitalist mode of production than in the nation with less developed. It follows, then, that the nominal wages, the equivalent of labour-power expressed in money, will also be higher in the first nation than in the second; which does not at all prove that this holds also for the real wages, i.e., for the means of subsistence placed at the disposal of the labourer.

Carey tries to prove that the wages of the different nations are directly proportional to the degree of productiveness of the national working-days, in order to draw from this international relation the conclusion that wages everywhere rise and fall in proportion to the productiveness of labour. The whole of our analysis of the production of surplus-value shows the absurdity of this conclusion, even if Carey himself had proved his premises instead of, after his usual uncritical and superficial fashion, shuffling to and fro a confused mass of statistical materials. The best of it is that he does not assert that things actually are as they ought to be according to his theory. For State intervention has falsified the natural economic relations. The different national wages must be reckoned, therefore, as if that part of each that goes to the State in the form of taxes, came to the labourer himself. Ought not Mr. Carey to consider further whether those “State expenses” are not the “natural”  fruits of capitalistic development? The reasoning is quite worthy of the man who first declared the relations of capitalist production to be eternal laws of nature and reason, whose free, harmonious working is only disturbed by the intervention of the State, in order afterwards to discover that the diabolical influence of England on the world market (an influence which, it appears, does not spring from the natural laws of capitalist production) necessitates State intervention, i.e., the protection of those laws of nature and reason by the State, alias the System of Protection. He discovered further that the theorems of Ricardo and others, in which existing social antagonisms and contradictions are formulated, are not the ideal product of the real economic movement, but on the contrary, that the real antagonisms of capitalist production in England and elsewhere are the result of the theories of Ricardo and others! Finally he discovered that it is, in the last resort, commerce that destroys the inborn beauties and harmonies of the capitalist mode of production. A step further and he will, perhaps, discover that the one evil in capitalist production is capital itself. Only a man with such atrocious want of the critical faculty and such spurious erudition deserved, in spite of his Protectionist heresy, to become the secret source of the harmonious wisdom of a Bastiat, and of all the other Free-trade optimists of today.

Whatever be the proportion of surplus-value which the industrial capitalist  retains for himself, or yields up to others, he is the one who, in the  first instance, appropriates it.

He has, therefore, produced not only  surplus-value, which we for the present regard as a fund to meet the private  consumption of the capitalist, but he has also produced, before it flows  back to him in the shape of wages, the fund out of which he himself is  paid, the variable capital; and his employment lasts only so long as he  continues to reproduce this fund. Hence, that formula of the economists,  referred to in Chapter XVIII, which represents wages as a share in the  product itself.  What flows back to the labourer in the shape of wages is a portion of the product that is continuously reproduced  by him. The capitalist, it is true, pays him in money, but this money is  merely the transmuted form of the product of his labour. While he is converting  a portion of the means of production into products, a portion of his former  product is being turned into money. It is his labour of last week, or of  last year, that pays for his labour-power this week or this year. The illusion  begotten by the intervention of money vanishes immediately,  if, instead of taking a single capitalist and a single labourer, we take  the class of capitalists and the class of labourers as a whole. The capitalist  class is constantly giving to the labouring class order-notes, in the form  of money, on a portion of the commodities produced by the latter and appropriated  by the former. The labourers give these order-notes back just as constantly  to the capitalist class, and in this way get their share of their own product.

If only a part, say one half,  were consumed, the same result would follow at the end of 10 years, since  10 × £100= £1,000. General Rule: The value of the capital advanced  divided by the surplus-value annually consumed, gives the number of years,  or reproduction periods, at the expiration of which the capital originally  advanced has been consumed by the capitalist and has disappeared. The capitalist  thinks, that he is consuming the produce of the unpaid labour of others,  i.e., the surplus-value, and is keeping intact his original capital;  but what he thinks cannot alter facts. After the lapse of a certain number  of years, the capital value he then possesses is equal to the sum total  of the surplus-value appropriated by him during those years, and the total  value he has consumed is equal to that of his original capital. It is true,  he has in hand a capital whose amount has not changed, and of which a part,  viz., the buildings, machinery, &c., were already there when the work  of his business began. But what we have to do with here, is not the material  elements, but the value, of that capital. When a person gets through all  his property, by taking upon himself debts equal to the value of that property,  it is clear that his property represents nothing but the sum total of his  debts. And so it is with the capitalist; when he has consumed the equivalent  of his original capital, the value of his present capital represents  nothing but the total amount of the surplus-value appropriated by him without  payment.

Even if that capital was originally acquired by the personal  labour of its employer, it sooner or later becomes value appropriated without  an equivalent, the unpaid labour of others materialised either in money  or in some other object. We saw in Chapt. IV.-VI. that in order to convert  money into capital something more is required than the production and circulation  of commodities. We saw that on the one side the possessor of value or money,  on the other, the possessor of the value-creating substance; on the one  side, the possessor of the means of production and subsistence, on the  other, the possessor of nothing but labour-power, must confront one another  as buyer and seller.

On  the one hand, the process of production incessantly converts material wealth  into capital, into means of creating more wealth and means of enjoyment  for the capitalist. On the other hand, the labourer, on quitting the process,  is what he was on entering it, a source of wealth, but devoid of all means  of making that wealth his own. Since, before entering on the process, his  own labour has already been alienated from himself by the sale of his labour-power,  has been appropriated by the capitalist and incorporated with capital,  it must, during the process, be realised in a product that does not belong  to him. Since the process of production is also the process by which the  capitalist consumes labour-power, the product of the labourer is incessantly  converted, not only into commodities, but into capital, into value that  sucks up the value-creating power, into means of subsistence that buy the  person of the labourer, into means of production that command the producers.

On the other hand, the labourer turns the  money paid to him for his labour-power, into means of subsistence: this  is his individual consumption. The labourer’s productive consumption, and  his individual consumption, are therefore totally distinct. In the former,  he acts as the motive power of capital, and belongs to the capitalist.

By converting  part of his capital into labour-power, the capitalist augments the value  of his entire capital. He kills two birds with one stone. He profits, not  only by what he receives from, but by what he gives to, the labourer. The  capital given in exchange for labour-power is converted into necessaries,  by the consumption of which the muscles, nerves, bones, and brains of existing  labourers are reproduced, and new labourers are begotten. Within the limits  of what is strictly necessary, the individual consumption of the working class  is, therefore, the reconversion of the means of subsistence given by capital  in exchange for labour-power, into fresh labour-power at the disposal of  capital for exploitation. It is the production and reproduction of that  means of production so indispensable to the capitalist: the labourer himself.  The individual consumption of the labourer, whether it proceed within the  workshop or outside it, whether it be part of the process of production  or not, forms therefore a factor of the production and reproduction of  capital; just as cleaning machinery does, whether it be done while the  machinery is working or while it is standing. The fact that the labourer  consumes his means of subsistence for his own purposes, and not to please  the capitalist, has no bearing on the matter. The consumption of food by  a beast of burden is none the less a necessary factor in the process of  production, because the beast enjoys what it eats. The maintenance and  reproduction of the working class is, and must ever be, a necessary condition  to the reproduction of capital. But the capitalist may safely leave its  fulfilment to the labourer’s instincts of self-preservation and of propagation.  All the capitalist cares for, is to reduce the labourer’s individual consumption  as far as possible to what is strictly necessary, and he is far away from  imitating those brutal South Americans, who force their labourers to take  the more substantial, rather than the less substantial, kind of food.

That process, however, takes good care to prevent these self-conscious  instruments from leaving it in the lurch, for it removes their product,  as fast as it is made, from their pole to the opposite pole of capital.  Individual consumption provides, on the one hand, the means for their maintenance  and reproduction: on the other hand, it secures by the annihilation of  the necessaries of life, the continued re-appearance of the workman in  the labour-market.

Mr. Potter talks of the trade reviving ‘in one, two, or three years,’ and  he asks us not ‘to encourage or allow (!) the working power to emigrate.’   He says that it is very natural the workers should wish to emigrate; but he thinks that in spite of their desire, the nation  ought to keep this half million of workers with their 700,000 dependents,  shut up in the cotton districts; and as a necessary consequence, he must  of course think that the nation ought to keep down their discontent by  force, and sustain them by alms — and upon the chance that the cotton  masters may some day want them.... The time is come when the great public  opinion of these islands must operate to save this ‘working power’ from  those who would deal with it as they would deal with iron, and coal, and  cotton.”   ","Simple

This is one of the few counties,  in which circumstances do not secure to the farmer undisputed proprietary  rights over the agricultural labourer. The mining industry allows the latter  some choice.

2499,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"First let us consider this transaction from the standpoint of  the individual capitalist. Suppose a spinner to have advanced a capital  of £10,000, of which four-fifths (£8,000) are laid out in cotton,  machinery, &c., and one-fifth (£2,000) in wages. Let him produce  240,000 lbs. of yarn annually, having a value of £12,000. The rate  of surplus-value being 100%, the surplus-value lies in the surplus or net  product of 40,000 lbs. of yarn, one-sixth of the gross product, with a  value of £2,000 which will be realised by a sale. £2,000 is  £2,000. We can neither see nor smell in this sum of money a trace  of surplus-value. When we know that a given value is surplus-value, we  know how its owner came by it; but that does not alter the nature either  of value or of money.  ","Conversion

2502,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"The capital value was originally advanced in the money form. The  surplus-value on the contrary is, originally, the value of a definite portion  of the gross product. If this gross product be sold, converted into money,  the capital value regains its original form. From this moment the capital value  and the surplus-value are both of them sums of money, and their reconversion  into capital takes place in precisely the same way. The one, as well as  the other, is laid out by the capitalist in the purchase of commodities  that place him in a position to begin afresh the fabrication of his goods,  and this time, on an extended scale. But in order to be able to buy those  commodities, he must find them ready in the market.  ","Conversion

But these commodities, before coming to market, were part of the general  annual product, part of the total mass of objects of every kind, into which  the sum of the individual capitals, i.e., the total capital of society,  had been converted in the course of the year, and of which each capitalist  had in hand only an aliquot part. The transactions in the market effectuate  only the interchange of the individual components of this annual product,  transfer them from one hand to another, but can neither augment the total  annual production, nor alter the nature of the objects produced. Hence  the use that can be made of the total annual product, depends entirely  upon its own composition, but in no way upon circulation.  ","Conversion

Deducting these there  remains the net or surplus-product, in which the surplus-value lies. And  of what does this surplus-product consist? Only of things destined to satisfy  the wants and desires of the capitalist class, things which, consequently,  enter into the consumption fund of the capitalists? Were that the case,  the cup of surplus-value would be drained to the very dregs, and nothing  but simple reproduction would ever take place.    ","Conversion

2505,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"To accumulate it is necessary to convert a portion of the surplus-product  into capital. But we cannot, except by a miracle, convert into capital  anything but such articles as can be employed in the labour process (i.e.,  means of production), and such further articles as are suitable for the  sustenance of the labourer (i.e., means of subsistence). Consequently,  a part of the annual surplus-labour must have been applied to the production  of additional means of production and subsistence, over and above the quantity  of these things required to replace the capital advanced. In one word,  surplus-value is convertible into capital solely because the  surplus-product, whose value it is, already comprises the material elements  of new capital.  ","Conversion
of Surplus-Value into Capital"
2506,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"Now in order to allow of these elements actually functioning as  capital, the capitalist class requires additional labour. If the exploitation  of the labourers already employed do not increase, either extensively or  intensively, then additional labour-power must be found. For this the mechanism  of capitalist production provides beforehand, by converting the working class  into a class dependent on wages, a class whose ordinary wages suffice,  not only for its maintenance, but for its increase. It is only necessary  for capital to incorporate this additional labour-power, annually supplied  by the working class in the shape of labourers of all ages, with the surplus  means of production comprised in the annual produce, and the conversion  of surplus-value into capital is complete. From a concrete point of view,  accumulation resolves itself into the reproduction of capital on a progressively  increasing scale. The circle in which simple reproduction moves, alters  its form, and, to use Sismondi’s expression, changes into a spiral.  ","Conversion

The original capital of £10,000  brings in a surplus-value of £2,000, which is capitalised. The new  capital of £2,000 brings in a surplus-value of £400, and this,  too, is capitalised, converted into a second additional capital, which,  in its turn, produces a further surplus-value of £80.

Just as little does it concern us, for the  moment, whether the additional capital is joined on to the original capital,  or is separated from it to function independently; whether the same capitalist,  who accumulated it, employs it, or whether he hands it over to another.  This only we must not forget, that by the side of the newly-formed capital,  the original capital continues to reproduce itself, and to produce surplus-value,  and that this is also true of all accumulated capital, and the additional  capital engendered by it.

2509,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"The original capital was formed by the advance of £10,000.  How did the owner become possessed of it? “By his own labour and that of  his forefathers,” answer unanimously the spokesmen of Political  Economy.

2510,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"But it is quite otherwise with regard to the additional capital  of £2,000. How that originated we know perfectly well. There is not  one single atom of its value that does not owe its existence to unpaid  labour. The means of production, with which the additional labour-power  is incorporated, as well as the necessaries with which the labourers are  sustained, are nothing but component parts of the surplus-product, of the  tribute annually exacted from the working class by the capitalist class.  Though the latter with a portion of that tribute purchases the additional  labour-power even at its full price, so that equivalent is exchanged for  equivalent, yet the transaction is for all that only the old dodge of every  conqueror who buys commodities from the conquered with the money he has  robbed them of.

2511,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"If the additional capital employs the person who produced it,  this producer must not only continue to augment the value of the original  capital, but must buy back the fruits of his previous labour with more  labour than they cost. When viewed as a transaction between the capitalist  class and the working class, it makes no difference that additional labourers  are employed by means of the unpaid labour of the previously employed labourers.  The capitalist may even convert the additional capital into a machine that  throws the producers of that capital out of work, and that replaces them  by a few children. In every case the working class creates by the surplus-labour  of one year the capital destined to employ additional labour in the following  year.  And this is what is called: creating capital out of capital.  ","Conversion

2512,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"The accumulation of the first additional capital of £2,000  presupposes a value of £10,000 belonging to the capitalist by virtue  of his “primitive labour,” and advanced by him. The second additional capital  of £400 presupposes, on the contrary, only the previous accumulation  of the £2,000, of which the £400 is the surplus-value capitalised.  The ownership of past unpaid labour is thenceforth the sole condition for  the appropriation of living unpaid labour on a constantly increasing scale.  The more the capitalist has accumulated, the more is he able to accumulate.  ","Conversion
of Surplus-Value into Capital"
2513,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"In so far as the surplus-value, of which the additional capital,  No. 1, consists, is the result of the purchase of labour-power with part  of the original capital, a purchase that conformed to the laws  of the exchange of commodities, and that, from a legal standpoint, presupposes  nothing beyond the free disposal, on the part of the labourer, of his own  capacities, and on the part of the owner of money or commodities, of the  values that belong to him; in so far as the additional capital, No. 2,  &c., is the mere result of No. 1, and, therefore, a consequence of  the above conditions; in so far as each single transaction invariably conforms  to the laws of the exchange of commodities, the capitalist buying labour-power,  the labourer selling it, and we will assume at its real value; in so far  as all this is true, it is evident that the laws of appropriation or of  private property, laws that are based on the production and circulation  of commodities, become by their own inner and inexorable dialectic changed  into their very opposite. The exchange of equivalents, the original operation  with which we started, has now become turned round in such a way that there  is only an apparent exchange. This is owing to the fact, first, that the  capital which is exchanged for labour-power is itself but a portion of  the product of others’ labour appropriated without an equivalent; and,  secondly, that this capital must not only be replaced by its producer,  but replaced together with an added surplus. The relation of exchange subsisting  between capitalist and labourer becomes a mere semblance appertaining to  the process of circulation, a mere form, foreign to the real nature of  the transaction, and only mystifying it. The ever repeated purchase and  sale of labour-power is now the mere form; what really takes place is this  — the capitalist again and again appropriates, without equivalent, a portion  of the previously materialised labour of others, and exchanges it for a  greater quantity of living labour. At first the rights of property seemed  to us to be based on a man’s own labour. At least, some such assumption  was necessary since only commodity-owners with equal rights confronted  each other, and the sole means by which a man could become possessed of  the commodities of others, was by alienating his own commodities; and these  could be replaced by labour alone. Now, however, property turns out to  be the right, on the part of the capitalist, to appropriate the unpaid  labour of others or its product, and to be the impossibility, on the part  of the labourer, of appropriating his own product. The separation of property  from labour has become the necessary consequence of a law that apparently  originated in their identity.  ","Conversion

2514,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"Therefore,  however much the capitalist  mode of appropriation may seem to fly in the face of the original laws  of commodity production, it nevertheless arises, not from a violation,  but, on the contrary, from the application of these laws.

2515,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm,"We saw, in the first place, that the original conversion of a  sum of values into capital was achieved in complete accordance with the  laws of exchange. One party to the contract sells his labour-power, the  other buys it. The former receives the value of his commodity, whose use value  — labour — is thereby alienated to the buyer. Means of production which  already belong to the latter are then transformed by him, with the aid  of labour equally belonging to him, into a new product which is likewise  lawfully his.

Instead of converting surplus-value into capital, he, on the contrary,  by the purchase of those commodities and that labour, consumes or expends  it as revenue. In the face of the habitual mode of life of the old feudal  nobility, which, as Hegel rightly says, “consists in consuming what is  in hand,” and more especially displays itself in the luxury of personal  retainers, it was extremely important for bourgeois economy to promulgate the doctrine that accumulation of capital is the first duty of every citizen, and to preach without ceasing, that a man cannot accumulate, if he eats up all his revenue, instead of spending a good part of it in the acquisition  of additional productive labourers, who bring in more than they cost. On  the other hand the economists had to contend against the popular prejudice,  that confuses capitalist production with hoarding,  and on the other hand, by the formation of reserve stocks; the latter, a phenomenon that is common to all modes  of production, and on which we shall dwell for a moment, when we come to  analyse circulation. Classical economy is therefore quite right, when it  maintains that the consumption of surplus-products by productive, instead  of by unproductive labourers, is a characteristic feature of the process  of accumulation. But at this point the mistakes also begin. Adam Smith  has made it the fashion, to represent accumulation as nothing more than  consumption of surplus products by productive labourers, which amounts  to saying, that the capitalising of surplus-value consists in merely turning  surplus-value into labour-power.","Conversion

So far from this being the  case, the surplus-value, like the original capital, divides itself into  constant capital and variable capital, into means of production and labour-power.  Labour-power is the form under which variable capital exists during the  process of production. In this process the labour-power is itself consumed  by the capitalist while the means of production are consumed by the labour-power  in the exercise of its function, labour. At the same time, the money paid  for the purchase of the labour-power, is converted into necessaries, that  are consumed, not by “productive labour,” but by the “productive labourer.”   Adam Smith, by a fundamentally perverted analysis, arrives at the absurd  conclusion, that even though each individual capital is divided into a  constant and a variable part, the capital of society resolves itself only  into variable capital, i.e., is laid out exclusively in payment of  wages. For instance, suppose a cloth manufacturer converts £2,000  into capital. One portion he lays out in buying weavers, the other in woollen  yarn, machinery, &c. But the people, from whom he buys the yarn and  the machinery, pay for labour with a part of the purchase money, and so  on until the whole £2,000 are spent in the payment of wages, i.e.,  until the entire product represented by the £2,000 has been consumed  by productive labourers. It is evident that the whole gist of this argument  lies in the words “and so on,” which send us from pillar to post.

Political  Economy values this fact so highly, that it occasionally identifies the  acceleration of accumulation due to increased productiveness of labour, with  its acceleration due to increased exploitation of the labourer.  In the chapters on the production of surplus-value it was constantly presupposed that wages are at least equal to the value of labour-power. Forcible reduction  of wages below this value plays, however, in practice too important a part,  for us not to pause upon it for a moment. It, in fact, transforms, within  certain limits, the labourer’s necessary consumption fund into a fund for  the accumulation of capital.     ","Conversion

In a factory, suppose that 100 labourers working  8 hours a day yield 800 working-hours. If the capitalist wishes to raise  this sum by one half, he can employ 50 more workers; but then he must also  advance more capital, not merely for wages, but for instruments of labour.  But he might also let the 100 labourers work 12 hours instead of 8, and  then the instruments of labour already to hand would be enough. These would  then simply be more rapidly consumed.

The division  of this product into revenue and additional capital remaining the same,  the consumption of the capitalist may, therefore, increase without any  decrease in the fund of accumulation. The relative magnitude of the accumulation fund  may even increase at the expense of the consumption fund, whilst the cheapening  of commodities places at the disposal of the capitalist as many means of  enjoyment as formerly, or even more than formerly. But hand-in-hand with  the increasing productivity of labour, goes, as we have seen, the cheapening  of the labourer, therefore a higher rate of surplus-value, even when the  real wages are rising. The latter never rise proportionally to the productive  power of labour. The same value in variable capital therefore sets in movement  more labour-power, and, therefore, more labour. The same value in constant  capital is embodied in more means of production, i.e., in more instruments  of labour, materials of labour and auxiliary materials; it therefore also  supplies more elements for the production both of use value and of value,  and with these more absorbers of labour. The value of the additional capital,  therefore, remaining the same or even diminishing, accelerated accumulation  still takes place. Not only does the scale of reproduction materially extend,  but the production of surplus-value increases more rapidly than the value  of the additional capital.  ","Conversion

A  part of the functioning constant capital consists of instruments of labour,  such as machinery, &c., which are not consumed, and therefore not reproduced,  or replaced by new ones of the same kind, until after long periods of time.  But every year a part of these instruments of labour perishes or reaches  the limit of its productive function. It reaches, therefore, in that  year, the time for its periodical reproduction, for its replacement by  new ones of the same kind. If the productiveness of labour has,  during the using up of these instruments of labour, increased (and it develops  continually with the uninterrupted advance of science and technology),  more efficient and (considering their increased efficiency), cheaper machines,  tools, apparatus, &c., replace the old. The old capital is reproduced  in a more productive form, apart from the constant detail improvements  in the instruments of labour already in use. The other part of the constant  capital, raw material and auxiliary substances, is constantly reproduced  in less than a year; those produced by agriculture, for the most part annually.  Every introduction of improved methods, therefore, works almost simultaneously  on the new capital and on that already in action. Every advance in Chemistry  not only multiplies the number of useful materials and the useful applications  of those already known, thus extending with the growth of capital its sphere  of investment. It teaches at the same time how to throw the excrements  of the processes of production and consumption back again into the circle  of the process of reproduction, and thus, without any previous outlay of  capital, creates new matter for capital. Like the increased exploitation  of natural wealth by the mere increase in the tension of labour-power,  science and technology give capital a power of expansion independent of  the given magnitude of the capital actually functioning. They react at  the same time on that part of the original capital which has entered upon  its stage of renewal. This, in passing into its new shape, incorporates  gratis the social advance made while its old shape was being used up. Of  course, this development of productive power is accompanied by a partial  depreciation of functioning capital. So far as this depreciation makes  itself acutely felt in competition, the burden falls on the labourer, in  the increased exploitation of whom the capitalist looks for his indemnification.

At the same time, it caused and stimulated increased reproduction of wool.  It is the natural property of living labour, to transmit old value, whilst  it creates new. Hence, with the increase in efficacy, extent and value  of its means of production, consequently with the accumulation that accompanies  the development of its productive power, labour keeps up and eternises  an always increasing capital value in a form ever new.”  This natural power of labour takes the appearance of an intrinsic property of capital, in which it is incorporated, just as the productive  forces of social labour take the appearance of inherent properties of capital,  and as the constant appropriation of surplus-labour by the capitalists,  takes that of a constant self-expansion of capital.

In the same proportion as these instruments of labour serve as  product-formers without adding value to the product, i.e., in the  same proportion as they are wholly employed but only partly consumed, they  perform, as we saw earlier, the same gratuitous service as the natural  forces, water, steam, air, electricity, etc. This gratuitous service of  past labour, when seized and filled with a soul by living labour, increases  with the advancing stages of accumulation.

In his description of the process of reproduction, and of accumulation, Adam Smith, in many ways, not only  made no advance, but even lost considerable ground, compared with his predecessors,  especially by the Physiocrats. Connected with the illusion mentioned in  the text, is the really wonderful dogma, left by him as an inheritance  to Political Economy, the dogma, that the price of commodities is made  up of wages, profit (interest) and rent, i.e., of wages and surplus-value.  Starting from this basis, Storch naively confesses, “Il est impossible  de résoudre le prix nécessaire dans ses éléments les plus simples.”    (Storch, l. c., Petersb.

Taking the usurer, that old-fashioned but ever renewed specimen of the capitalist for his text, Luther shows  very aptly that the love of power is an element in the desire to get rich.   “The heathen were able, by the light of reason, to conclude that a usurer  is a double-dyed thief and murderer. We Christians, however, hold them  in such honour, that we fairly worship them for the sake of their money....  Whoever eats up, robs, and steals the nourishment of another, that man  commits as great a murder (so far as in him lies) as he who starves a man  or utterly undoes him. Such does a usurer, and sits the while safe on his  stool, when he ought rather to be hanging on the gallows, and be eaten  by as many ravens as he has stolen guilders, if only there were so much  flesh on him, that so many ravens could stick their beaks in and share  it. Meanwhile, we hang the small thieves.... Little thieves are put in  the stocks, great thieves go flaunting in gold and silk.... Therefore is  there, on this earth, no greater enemy of man (after the devil) than a  gripe-money, and usurer, for he wants to be God over all men. Turks, soldiers,  and tyrants are also bad men, yet must they let the people live, and Confess  that they are bad, and enemies, and do, nay, must, now and then show pity  to some. But a usurer and money-glutton, such a one would have the whole  world perish of hunger and thirst, misery and want, so far as in him lies,  so that he may have all to himself, and every one may receive from him  as from a God, and be his serf for ever. To wear fine cloaks, golden chains,  rings, to wipe his mouth, to be deemed and taken for a worthy, pious man  .... Usury is a great huge monster, like a werewolf, who lays waste all,  more than any Cacus, Gerion or Antus. And yet decks himself out, and would  be thought pious, so that people may not see where the oxen have gone,  that he drags backwards into his den. But Hercules shall hear the cry of  the oxen and of his prisoners, and shall seek Cacus even in cliffs and  among rocks, and shall set the oxen loose again from the villain. For Cacus  means the villain that is a pious usurer, and steals, robs, eats everything.  And will not own that he has done it, and thinks no one will find him out,  because the oxen, drawn backwards into his den, make it seem, from their  foot-prints, that they have been let out. So the usurer would deceive the  world, as though he were of use and gave the world oxen, which he, however,  rends, and eats all alone... And since we break on the wheel, and behead  highwaymen, murderers and housebreakers, how much more ought we to break  on the wheel and kill.... hunt down, curse and behead all usurers.” (Martin  Luther, l. c.)","Conversion

Classic economy has, on account of a deficient analysis of the labour process, and of the process of creating  value, never properly grasped this weighty element of reproduction, as  may be seen in Ricardo; he says, e.g., whatever the change in productive  power, “a million men always produce in manufactures the same value.” This  is accurate, if the extension and degree of intensity of their labour are  given. But it does not prevent (this Ricardo overlooks in certain conclusions  he draws) a million men with different powers of productivity in their  labour, turning into products very different masses of the means of production,  and therefore preserving in their products very different masses of value;  in consequence of which the values of the products yielded may vary considerably.  Ricardo has, it may be noted in passing, tried in vain to make clear to  J. B. Say, by that very example, the difference between use value (which  he here calls wealth or material riches) and exchange-value. Say answers:   “Quant à la difficulté qu’élève Mr. Ricardo  en disant que, par des procédés mieux entendus un million  de personnes peuvent produire deux fois, trois fois autant de richesses,  sans produire plus de valeurs, cette difficulté n’est pas une lorsque  l’on considére, ainsi qu’on le doit, la production comme un échange  dans lequel on donne les services productifs de son travail, de sa terre,  et de ses capitaux, pour obtenir des produits. C’est par le moyen de ces  services productifs, que nous acquérons tous les produits qui sont  au monde. Or... nous sommes d’autant plus riches, nos services productifs  ont d’autant plus de valeur qu’ils obtiennent dans l’échange appelé  production une plus grande quantité de choses utiles.”   Doubtless, and in consequence of the  same process, they will appear everything else, except original.” (“An  Inquiry into those Principles Respecting the Nature of Demand, &c.,”   pp. 116, 110.)","Conversion

Not even excepting our philosopher, Christian Wolff, in no time and in  no country has the most homespun commonplace ever strutted about in so  self-satisfied a way. The principle of utility was no discovery of Bentham.  He simply reproduced in his dull way what Helvétius and other Frenchmen  had said with esprit in the 18th century. To know what is useful for a  dog, one must study dog-nature. This nature itself is not to be deduced  from the principle of utility. Applying this to man, he that would criticise  all human acts, movements, relations, etc., by the principle of utility,  must first deal with human nature in general, and then with human nature  as modified in each historical epoch. Bentham makes short work of it. With  the driest naiveté he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the  English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer  normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure,  then, he applies to past, present, and future.

On the side of material, as it  functions in the process of production, all capital is divided into means of  production and living labour power. This latter composition is determined by  the relation between the mass of the means of production employed, on the one  hand, and the mass of labour necessary for their employment on the other.

If we suppose that, all other circumstances remaining the same,  the composition of capital also remains constant (i.e., that a  definite mass of means of production constantly needs the same mass of labour  power to set it in motion), then the demand for labour and the subsistence-fund  of the labourers clearly increase in the same proportion as the capital, and  the more rapidly, the more rapidly the capital increases. Since the capital  produces yearly a surplus-value, of which one part is yearly added to the  original capital; since this increment itself grows yearly along with the  augmentation of the capital already functioning; since lastly, under special  stimulus to enrichment, such as the opening of new markets, or of new spheres  for the outlay of capital in consequence of newly developed social wants,  &c., the scale of accumulation may be suddenly extended, merely by a change  in the division of the surplus-value or surplus-product into capital and  revenue, the requirements of accumulating capital may exceed the increase of  labour power or of the number of labourers; the demand for labourers may exceed  the supply, and, therefore, wages may rise. This must, indeed, ultimately be  the case if the conditions supposed above continue. For since in each year more  labourers are employed than in its predecessor, sooner or later a point must be  reached, at which the requirements of accumulation begin to surpass the  customary supply of labour, and, therefore, a rise of wages takes place. A  lamentation on this score was heard in England during the whole of the  fifteenth, and the first half of the eighteenth centuries. The more or less  favourable circumstances in which the wage working class supports and  multiplies itself, in no way alter the fundamental character of capitalist  production. As simple reproduction constantly reproduces the  capital relation itself, i.e., the relation of capitalists on the one  hand, and wage workers on the other, so reproduction on a progressive scale,  i.e., accumulation, reproduces the capital relation on a progressive  scale, more capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole, more wage workers  at that. The reproduction of a mass of labour power, which must incessantly  re-incorporate itself with capital for that capital’s self-expansion;  which cannot get free from capital, and whose enslavement to capital is only  concealed by the variety of individual capitalists to whom it sells itself,  this reproduction of labour power forms, in fact, an essential of the  reproduction of capital itself. Accumulation of capital is, therefore, increase  of the proletariat.  ","The

A larger part  of their own surplus-product, always increasing and continually transformed  into additional capital, comes back to them in the shape of means of payment,  so that they can extend the circle of their enjoyments; can make some additions  to their consumption-fund of clothes, furniture, &c., and can lay by small  reserve funds of money. But just as little as better clothing, food, and  treatment, and a larger peculium, do away with the exploitation of the slave,  so little do they set aside that of the wage worker. A rise in the price of  labour, as a consequence of accumulation of capital, only means, in fact, that  the length and weight of the golden chain the wage worker has already forged  for himself, allow of a relaxation of the tension of it. In the  controversies on this subject the chief fact has generally been overlooked,  viz., the differentia specifica {defining characteristic} of capitalistic production. Labour power  is sold today, not with a view of satisfying, by its service or by its product,  the personal needs of the buyer. His aim is augmentation of  his capital, production of commodities containing more labour than he pays for,  containing therefore a portion of value that costs him nothing, and that is  nevertheless realised when the commodities are sold. Production of  surplus-value is the absolute law of this mode of production. Labour power is  only saleable so far as it preserves the means of production in their capacity  of capital, reproduces its own value as capital, and yields in unpaid labour a  source of additional capital.   The conditions of its sale, whether more or less favourable to the labourer,  include therefore the necessity of its constant re-selling, and the constantly  extended reproduction of all wealth in the shape of capital. Wages, as we have  seen, by their very nature, always imply the performance of a certain quantity  of unpaid labour on the part of the labourer. Altogether, irrespective of the  case of a rise of wages with a falling price of labour, &c., such an  increase only means at best a quantitative diminution of the unpaid labour that  the worker has to supply. This diminution can never reach the point at which it  would threaten the system itself. Apart from violent conflicts as to the rate  of wages (and Adam Smith has already shown that in such a conflict, taken on  the whole, the master is always master), a rise in the price of labour  resulting from accumulation of capital implies the following alternative: ","The
General Law of Capitalist Accumulation"
2696,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"Either the price of labour keeps on rising, because its rise does not  interfere with the progress of accumulation. In this there is nothing  wonderful, for, says Adam Smith, “after these (profits) are diminished,  stock may not only continue to increase, but to increase much faster than  before.... A great stock, though with small profits, generally increases faster  than a small stock with great profits.” (l. c., ii, p. 189.) In this case  it is evident that a diminution in the unpaid labour in no way interferes with  the extension of the domain of capital. — Or, on the other hand,  accumulation slackens in consequence of the rise in the price of labour,  because the stimulus of gain is blunted. The rate of accumulation lessens; but  with its lessening, the primary cause of that lessening vanishes,  i.e., the disproportion between capital and exploitable labour power.  The mechanism of the process of capitalist production removes the  very obstacles that it temporarily creates. The price of labour falls again to  a level corresponding with the needs of the self-expansion of capital, whether  the level be below, the same as, or above the one which was normal before the  rise of wages took place. We see thus: In the first case, it is not the  diminished rate either of the absolute, or of the proportional, increase in  labour power, or labouring population, which causes capital to be in excess,  but conversely the excess of capital that makes exploitable labour power  insufficient. In the second case, it is not the increased rate either of the  absolute, or of the proportional, increase in labour power, or labouring  population, that makes capital insufficient; but, conversely, the relative  diminution of capital that causes the exploitable labour power, or rather its  price, to be in excess. It is these absolute movements of the accumulation of  capital which are reflected as relative movements of the mass of exploitable  labour power, and therefore seem produced by the latter’s own independent  movement. To put it mathematically: the rate  of accumulation is the independent, not the dependent, variable; the rate of  wages, the dependent, not the independent, variable. Thus, when the industrial  cycle is in the phase of crisis, a general fall in the price of commodities is  expressed as a rise in the value of money, and, in the phase of prosperity, a  general rise in the price of commodities, as a fall in the value of money. The  so-called currency school concludes from this that with high prices too much,  with low prices too little  are worthily paralleled by the  economists, who interpret the above phenomena of accumulation by saying that  there are now too few, now too many wage labourers. ","The
General Law of Capitalist Accumulation"
2697,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"The law of capitalist production, that is at the bottom of the pretended  “natural law of population,” reduces itself simply to this: The  correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is nothing else  than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into capital, and  the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of this  additional capital. It is therefore in no way a relation between two  magnitudes, independent one of the other: on the one hand, the magnitude of the  capital; on the other, the number of the labouring population; it is rather, at  bottom, only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the same  labouring population. If the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the working  class, and accumulated by the capitalist class, increases so rapidly that its  conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of paid labour, then  wages rise, and, all other circumstances remaining equal, the unpaid  labour diminishes in proportion. But as soon as this diminution touches the  point at which the surplus labour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied  in normal quantity, a reaction sets in: a smaller part of revenue is  capitalised, accumulation lags, and the movement of rise in wages receives a  check. The rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only  leave intact the foundations of the capitalistic system, but also secure its  reproduction on a progressive scale. The law of capitalistic accumulation,  metamorphosed by economists into pretended law of Nature, in  reality merely states that the very nature of accumulation excludes every  diminution in the degree of exploitation of labour, and every rise in the price  of labour, which could seriously imperil the continual reproduction, on an  ever-enlarging scale, of the capitalistic relation. It cannot be otherwise in a  mode of production in which the labourer exists to satisfy the needs of  self-expansion of existing values, instead of, on the contrary, material wealth  existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer. As,  in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in  capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.  ","The

The mass of the means of production which he thus transforms,  increases with the productiveness of his labour. But those means of production  play a double part. The increase of some is a consequence, that of the others a  condition of the increasing productivity of labour. E.g., with the  division of labour in manufacture, and with the use of machinery, more raw  material is worked up in the same time, and, therefore, a greater mass of raw  material and auxiliary substances enter into the labour process. That is the  consequence of the increasing productivity of labour. On the other hand, the  mass of machinery, beasts of burden, mineral manures, drain-pipes, &c., is  a condition of the increasing productivity of labour. So also is it with the  means of production concentrated in buildings, furnaces, means of transport,  &c. But whether condition or consequence, the growing extent of the means  of production, as compared with the labour power incorporated with them, is an  expression of the growing productiveness of labour. The increase of the latter  appears, therefore, in the diminution of the mass of labour in proportion to  the mass of means of production moved by it, or in the diminution of the  subjective factor of the labour process as compared with the objective factor.

There may be, e.g., originally 50 per cent. of a capital laid out in  means of production, and 50 per cent. in labour power; later on, with the  development of the productivity of labour, 80 per cent. in means of production,  20 per cent. in labour power, and so on. This law of the progressive increase  in constant capital, in proportion to the variable, is confirmed at every step  (as already shown) by the comparative analysis of the prices of commodities,  whether we compare different economic epochs or different nations in the same  epoch. The relative magnitude of the element of price, which represents the  value of the means of production only, or the constant part of capital  consumed, is in direct, the relative magnitude of the other element of price  that pays labour (the variable part of capital) is in inverse proportion to the  advance of accumulation.

The reason is simply that, with the increasing productivity of labour, not only  does the mass of the means of production consumed by it increase, but their  value compared with their mass diminishes. Their value therefore rises  absolutely, but not in proportion to their mass. The increase of the difference  between constant and variable capital, is, therefore, much less than that of  the difference between the mass of the means of production into which the  constant, and the mass of the labour power into which the variable, capital is  converted. The former difference increases with the latter, but in a smaller  degree. ","The

2708,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"In Part IV, it was shown, how the development of the productiveness of  social labour presupposes co-operation on a large scale; how it is only upon  this supposition that division and combination of labour can be organised, and  the means of production economised by concentration on a vast scale; how  instruments of labour which, from their very nature, are only fit for use in  common, such as a system of machinery, can be called into being; how huge  natural forces can be pressed into the service of production; and how the  transformation can be effected of the process of production into a  technological application of science. On the basis of the production of  commodities, where the means of production are the property of private persons,  and where the artisan therefore either produces commodities, isolated from and  independent of others, or sells his labour power as a commodity, because he  lacks the means for independent industry, co-operation on a large scale can  realise itself only in the increase of individual capitals, only in proportion  as the means of social production and the means of subsistence are transformed  into the private property of capitalists. The basis of the production of  commodities can admit of production on a large scale in the capitalistic form  alone. A certain accumulation of capital, in the hands of individual producers  of commodities, forms therefore the necessary preliminary of the specifically  capitalistic mode of production. We had, therefore, to assume that this occurs  during the transition from handicraft to capitalistic industry. It may be  called primitive accumulation, because it is the historic basis, instead of the  historic result of specifically capitalist production. How it itself  originates, we need not here inquire as yet. It is enough that it forms the  starting point. But all methods for raising the social productive power of  labour that are developed on this basis, are at the same time methods for the  increased production of surplus-value or surplus-product, which in its turn is  the formative element of accumulation. They are, therefore, at the same time  methods of the production of capital by capital, or methods of its accelerated  accumulation. The continual re-transformation of surplus-value into capital now  appears in the shape of the increasing magnitude of the capital that enters  into the process of production. This in turn is the basis of an extended scale  of production, of the methods for raising the productive power of labour that  accompany it, and of accelerated production of surplus-value. If, therefore, a  certain degree of accumulation of capital appears as a condition of the  specifically capitalist mode of production, the latter causes conversely an  accelerated accumulation of capital. With the accumulation of capital,  therefore, the specifically capitalistic mode of production develops, and with  the capitalist mode of production the accumulation of capital. Both these  economic factors bring about, in the compound ratio of the impulses they  reciprocally give one another, that change in the technical composition of  capital by which the variable constituent becomes always smaller and smaller as  compared with the constant.

Every accumulation becomes the means of new accumulation. With the increasing  mass of wealth which functions as capital, accumulation increases the  concentration of that wealth in the hands of individual capitalists, and  thereby widens the basis of production on a large scale and of the specific  methods of capitalist production. The growth of social capital is  effected by the growth of many individual capitals. All other circumstances  remaining the same, individual capitals, and with them the concentration of the  means of production, increase in such proportion as they form aliquot parts of  the total social capital. At the same time portions of the original capitals  disengage themselves and function as new independent capitals. Besides other  causes, the division of property, within capitalist families, plays a great  part in this. With the accumulation of capital, therefore, the number of  capitalists grows to a greater or less extent. Two points characterise this  kind of concentration which grows directly out of, or rather is identical with,  accumulation. First: The increasing concentration of the social means of  production in the hands of individual capitalists is, other things remaining  equal, limited by the degree of increase of social wealth. Second: The part of  social capital domiciled in each particular sphere of production is divided  among many capitalists who face one another as independent commodity-producers  competing with each other. Accumulation and the concentration accompanying it  are, therefore, not only scattered over many points, but the increase of each  functioning capital is thwarted by the formation of new and the sub-division of  old capitals. Accumulation, therefore, presents itself on the one hand as  increasing concentration of the means of production, and of the command over  labour; on the other, as repulsion of many individual capitals one from  another.

It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of  their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist,  transformation of many small into few large capitals. This process differs from  the former in this, that it only presupposes a change in the distribution of  capital already to hand, and functioning; its field of action is therefore not  limited by the absolute growth of social wealth, by the absolute limits of  accumulation. Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand,  because it has in another place been lost by many. This is centralisation  proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration. ","The

A brief hint at a few facts must suffice.  The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness  of commodities demands, caeteris paribus, on the productiveness of  labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger  capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with  the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in  the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under  its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd  into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or  incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages in direct proportion to the  number, and in inverse proportion to the magnitudes, of the antagonistic  capitals. It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals  partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish. Apart from this,  with capitalist production an altogether new force comes into play — the  credit system, which in its first stages furtively creeps in as the humble  assistant of accumulation, drawing into the hands of individual or associated  capitalists, by invisible threads, the money resources which lie scattered,  over the surface of society, in larger or smaller amounts; but it soon becomes  a new and terrible weapon in the battle of competition and is finally  transformed into an enormous social mechanism for the centralisation of  capitals.

At the same time the progress of accumulation  increases the material amenable to centralisation, i.e., the  individual capitals, whilst the expansion of capitalist production creates, on  the one hand, the social want, and, on the other, the technical means necessary  for those immense industrial undertakings which require a previous  centralisation of capital for their accomplishment. Today, therefore, the force  of attraction, drawing together individual capitals, and the tendency to  centralisation are stronger than ever before. But if the relative extension and  energy of the movement towards centralisation is determined, in a certain  degree, by the magnitude of capitalist wealth and superiority of economic  mechanism already attained, progress in centralisation does not in any way  depend upon a positive growth in the magnitude of social capital. And this is the specific difference between centralisation and  concentration, the latter being only another name for reproduction on an  extended scale. Centralisation may result from a mere change in the  distribution of capitals already existing, from a simple alteration in the  quantitative grouping of the component parts of social capital. Here capital  can grow into powerful masses in a single hand because there it has been  withdrawn from many individual hands. In any given branch of industry  centralisation would reach its extreme limit if all the individual capitals  invested in it were fused into  a single capital.  In a given society the limit would  be reached only when the entire social capital was united in the hands of  either a single capitalist or a single capitalist company. ","The

Everywhere  the increased scale of industrial establishments is the starting point for a  more comprehensive organisation of the collective work of many, for a wider  development of their material motive forces — in other words, for the  progressive transformation of isolated processes of production, carried on by  customary methods, into processes of production socially combined and  scientifically arranged.

2722,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"The specifically capitalist mode of production, the development of the  productive power of labour corresponding to it, and the change thence resulting  in the organic composition of capital, do not merely keep pace with the advance  of accumulation, or with the growth of social wealth. They develop at a much  quicker rate, because mere accumulation, the absolute increase of the total  social capital, is accompanied by the centralisation of the individual capitals  of which that total is made up; and because the change in the technological  composition of the additional capital goes hand in hand with a similar change  in the technological composition of the original capital. With the advance of  accumulation, therefore, the proportion of constant to variable capital  changes. If it was originally say 1:1, it now becomes successively 2:1, 3:1,  4:1, 5:1, 7:1, &c., so that, as the capital increases, instead of ½ of its  total value, only 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, &c., is transformed into  labour-power, and, on the other hand, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 7/8 into  means of production. Since the demand for labour is determined not by the  amount of capital as a whole, but by its variable constituent alone, that  demand falls progressively with the increase of the total capital, instead of,  as previously assumed, rising in proportion to it. It falls relatively to the  magnitude of the total capital, and at an accelerated rate, as this magnitude  increases. With the growth of the total capital, its variable constituent or  the labour incorporated in it, also does increase, but in a constantly  diminishing proportion. The intermediate pauses are shortened, in which  accumulation works as simple extension of production, on a given technical  basis. It is not merely that an accelerated accumulation of total capital,  accelerated in a constantly growing progression, is needed to absorb an  additional number of labourers, or even, on account of the constant  metamorphosis of old capital, to keep employed those already functioning. In  its turn, this increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of  new changes in the composition of capital, of a more accelerated diminution of  its variable, as compared with its constant constituent. This accelerated  relative diminution of the variable constituent, that goes along with the  accelerated increase of the total capital, and moves more rapidly than this  increase, takes the inverse form, at the other pole, of an apparently absolute  increase of the labouring population, an increase always moving more rapidly  than that of the variable capital or the means of employment. But in fact, it  is capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces, and produces in  the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant  population of labourers, i.e., a population of greater extent than  suffices for the average needs of the self-expansion of capital, and therefore  a surplus population.

2723,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"Considering the social capital in its totality, the movement of its  accumulation now causes periodical changes, affecting it more or less as a  whole, now distributes its various phases simultaneously over the different  spheres of production. In some spheres a change in the composition of capital  occurs without increase of its absolute magnitude, as a consequence of simple  centralisation; in others the absolute growth of capital is connected with  absolute diminution of its variable constituent, or of the labour power  absorbed by it; in others again, capital continues growing for a time on its  given technical basis, and attracts additional labour power  in proportion to its increase, while at other times it undergoes organic  change, and lessens its variable constituent; in all spheres, the increase of  the variable part of capital, and therefore of the number of labourers employed  by it, is always connected with violent fluctuations and transitory production  of surplus population, whether this takes the more striking form of  the repulsion of labourers already employed, or the less evident but not less  real form of the more difficult absorption of the additional labouring  population through the usual channels.  This is a law of population peculiar to the  capitalist mode of production; and in fact every special historic  mode of production has its own special laws of population, historically valid  within its limits and only in so far as man has not interfered with them. ","The

2724,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"But if a surplus labouring population is a necessary product of accumulation  or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus population  becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalistic accumulation, nay, a condition  of existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable  industrial reserve army, that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the  latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual  increase of population, it creates, for the changing needs of the  self-expansion of capital, a mass of human material always ready for  exploitation. With accumulation, and the development of the productiveness of  labour that accompanies it, the power of sudden expansion of capital grows  also; it grows, not merely because the elasticity of the capital already  functioning increases, not merely because the absolute wealth of society  expands, of which capital only forms an elastic part, not merely because  credit, under every special stimulus, at once places an unusual part of this  wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional capital; it  grows, also, because the technical conditions of the process of production  themselves — machinery, means of transport, &c. — now admit of  the rapidest transformation of masses of surplus-product into additional means  of production. The mass of social wealth, overflowing with the advance of  accumulation, and transformable into additional capital, thrusts itself  frantically into old branches of production, whose market suddenly expands, or  into newly formed branches, such as railways, &c., the need for which grows  out of the development of the old ones. In all such cases, there must be the  possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points  without injury to the scale of production in other spheres. Overpopulation  supplies these masses. The course characteristic of modern industry,  viz., a decennial cycle (interrupted by smaller oscillations), of  periods of average activity, production at high pressure, crisis and  stagnation, depends on the constant formation, the greater or less absorption,  and the re-formation of the industrial reserve army or surplus population. In  their turn, the varying phases of the industrial cycle recruit the surplus  population, and become one of the most energetic agents of its reproduction.  This peculiar course of modern industry, which occurs in no earlier period of  human history, was also impossible in the childhood of capitalist production.  The composition of capital changed but very slowly. With its accumulation,  therefore, there kept pace, on the whole, a corresponding growth in the demand  for labour. Slow as was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more  modern times, it found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable  labouring population, limits which could only be got rid of by forcible means  to be mentioned later. The expansion by fits and starts of the scale of  production is the preliminary to its equally sudden contraction; the latter  again evokes the former, but the former is impossible without disposable human  material, without an increase, in the number of labourers independently of the  absolute growth of the population. This increase is effected by the simple  process that constantly “sets free” a part of the labourers; by  methods which lessen the number of labourers employed in proportion to the  increased production. The whole form of the movement of modern industry  depends, therefore, upon the constant transformation of a part of the labouring  population into unemployed or half-employed hands. The superficiality of  Political Economy shows itself in the fact that it looks upon the expansion and  contraction of credit, which is a mere symptom of the periodic changes of the  industrial cycle, as their cause. As the heavenly bodies, once thrown into a  certain definite motion, always repeat this, so is it with social production as  soon as it is once thrown into this movement of alternate expansion and  contraction. Effects, in their turn, become causes, and the varying accidents  of the whole process, which always reproduces its own conditions, take on the  form of periodicity. When this periodicity is once consolidated, even Political  Economy then sees that the production of a relative surplus population —  i.e., surplus with regard to the average needs of the self-expansion  of capital — is a necessary condition of modern industry.

That,  at the first returning demand for labour, there would be a  deficiency. However rapid reproduction may be, it takes, at all  events, the space of a generation to replace the loss of adult labour. Now, the  profits of our manufacturers depend mainly on the power of making use of the  prosperous moment when demand is brisk, and thus compensating themselves for  the interval during which it is slack. This power is secured  to them only by the command of machinery and of manual labour. They must have  hands ready by them, they must be able to increase the activity of their  operations when required, and to slacken it again, according to the state of  the market, or they cannot possibly maintain that pre-eminence in the race of  competition on which the wealth of the country is founded.” ","The

Increase of variable capital, in this case,  becomes an index of more labour, but not of more labourers employed. It is the  absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out  of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about  the same. In the latter case, the outlay of constant capital increases in  proportion to the mass of labour set in action; in the former that increase is  much smaller.

We have further seen that the  capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of labour power, as he  progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled, mature labour power  by immature, male by female, that of adults by that of young persons or  children.

2735,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"The production of a relative surplus population, or the setting free of  labourers, goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of  the process of production that accompanies, and is accelerated by, the advance  of accumulation; and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the  variable part of capital as compared with the constant. If the means of  production, as they increase in extent and effective power, become to a less  extent means of employment of labourers, this state of things is again modified  by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases,  capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for  labourers. The overwork of the employed part of the working class swells the  ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by  its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to overwork and to  subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of one  part of the working class to enforced idleness by the overwork of the other  part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual  capitalists,  and accelerates  at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale  corresponding with the advance of social accumulation. How important is this  element in the formation of the relative surplus population, is shown by the  example of England. Her technical means for saving labour are colossal.  Nevertheless, if to-morrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational  amount, and proportioned to the different sections of the working class  according to age and sex, the working population to hand would be absolutely  insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale.  The great majority of the labourers now “unproductive” would have  to be turned into “productive” ones. ","The

They  are, therefore, not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the  working population, but by the varying proportions in which the working class  is divided into active and reserve army, by the increase or diminution in the  relative amount of the surplus population, by the extent to which it is now  absorbed, now set free. For Modern Industry with its decennial cycles and  periodic phases, which, moreover, as accumulation advances, are complicated by  irregular oscillations following each other more and more quickly,  that would indeed be a beautiful law, which pretends to make the  action of capital dependent on the absolute variation of the population,  instead of regulating the demand and supply of labour by the alternate  expansion and contraction of capital, the labour-market now appearing  relatively under-full, because capital is expanding, now again over-full,  because it is contracting. Yet this is the dogma of the economists. According  to them, wages rise in consequence of accumulation of capital. The higher wages  stimulate the working population to more rapid multiplication, and this goes on  until the labour-market becomes too full, and therefore capital, relatively to  the supply of labour, becomes insufficient. Wages fall, and now we have the  reverse of the medal. The working population is little by little decimated as  the result of the fall in wages, so that capital is again in excess relatively  to them, or, as others explain it, falling wages and the corresponding increase  in the exploitation of the labourer again accelerates accumulation, whilst, at  the same time, the lower wages hold the increase of the working class in check.  Then comes again the time, when the supply of labour is less than the demand,  wages rise, and so on. A beautiful mode of motion this for developed capitalist  production! Before, in consequence of the rise of wages, any positive increase  of the population really fit for work could occur, the time would have been  passed again and again, during which the industrial campaign must have been  carried through, the battle fought and won.

In Wiltshire, e.g., the weekly wages rose from 7s. to 8s.;  in Dorsetshire from 7s. or 8s., to 9s., &c. This was the result of an  unusual exodus of the agricultural surplus population caused by the demands of  war, the vast extension of railroads, factories, mines, &c. The lower the  wages, the higher is the proportion in which ever so insignificant a rise of  them expresses itself. If the weekly wage, e.g., is 20s. and it rises  to 22s., that is a rise of 10 per cent.; but if it is only 7s. and it rises to  9s., that is a rise of 28 4/7 per cent., which sounds very fine. Everywhere the  farmers were howling, and the London Economist, with reference to  these starvation-wages, prattled quite seriously of “a general and  substantial advance.”   What did the farmers do now? Did they wait until, in consequence of this  brilliant remuneration, the agricultural labourers had so increased and  multiplied that their wages must fall again, as prescribed by the dogmatic  economic brain? They introduced more machinery, and in a moment the labourers  were redundant again in a proportion satisfactory even to the  farmers. There was now “more capital” laid out in agriculture than  before, and in a more productive form. With this the demand for labour fell,  not only relatively, but absolutely. ","The

The higher  wages draw a larger part of the working population into the more favoured  sphere, until it is glutted with labour power, and wages at length fall again  to their average level or below it, if the pressure is too great. Then, not  only does the immigration of labourers into the branch of industry in question  cease; it gives place to their emigration. Here the political economist thinks  he sees the why and wherefore of an absolute increase of workers accompanying  an increase of wages, and of a diminution of wages accompanying an absolute  increase of labourers.

It will be remembered that if through the introduction of new, or  the extension of old, machinery, a portion of variable capital is transformed  into constant, the economic apologist interprets this operation which  “fixes” capital and by that very act sets labourers  “free,” in exactly the opposite way, pretending that it sets free  capital for the labourers. Only now can one fully understand the effrontery of  these apologists. What are set free are not only the labourers immediately  turned out by the machines, but also their future substitutes in the rising  generation, and the additional contingent, that with the usual extension of  trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed. They are now all “set  free,” and every new bit of capital looking out for employment  can dispose of them. Whether it attracts them or others, the effect on the  general labour demand will be nil, if this capital is just sufficient to take  out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw upon it. If it  employs a smaller number, that of the supernumeraries increases; if it employs  a greater, the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the  excess of the employed over those “set free.” The impulse that  additional capital, seeking an outlet, would otherwise have given to the  general demand for labour, is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent  of the labourers thrown out of employment by the machine. That is to say, the  mechanism of capitalistic production so manages matters that the absolute  increase of capital is accompanied by no corresponding rise in the general  demand for labour. And this the apologist calls a compensation for the misery,  the sufferings, the possible death of the displaced labourers during the  transition period that banishes them into the industrial reserve army!

The action of the law of supply and  demand of labour on this basis completes the despotism of capital. As soon,  therefore, as the labourers learn the secret, how it comes to pass that in the  same measure as they work more, as they produce more wealth for others, and as  the productive power of their labour increases, so in the same measure even  their function as a means of the self-expansion of capital becomes more and  more precarious for them; as soon as they discover that the degree of intensity  of the competition among themselves depends wholly on the pressure of the  relative surplus population; as soon as, by Trades’ Unions, &c., they  try to organise a regular co-operation between employed and unemployed in order  to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of this natural law of capitalistic  production on their class, so soon capital and its sycophant, Political  Economy, cry out at the infringement of the “eternal” and so to say  “sacred” law of supply and demand. Every combination of employed  and unemployed disturbs the “harmonious” action of this law. But,  on the other hand, as soon as (in the colonies, e.g.) adverse  circumstances prevent the creation of an industrial reserve army and, with it,  the absolute dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class,  capital, along with its commonplace Sancho Panza, rebels against the  “sacred” law of supply and demand, and tries to check its  inconvenient action by forcible means and State interference.

One need only glance superficially at  the statistics of English pauperism to find that the quantity of paupers  increases with every crisis, and diminishes with every revival of trade.  Second, orphans and pauper children. These are candidates for the industrial  reserve army, and are, in times of great prosperity, as 1860, e.g.,  speedily and in large numbers enrolled in the active army of  labourers. Third, the demoralised and ragged, and those unable to work, chiefly  people who succumb to their incapacity for adaptation, due to the division of  labour; people who have passed the normal age of the labourer; the victims of  industry, whose number increases with the increase of dangerous machinery, of  mines, chemical works, &c., the mutilated, the sickly, the widows, &c.  Pauperism is the hospital of the active labour-army and the dead weight of the  industrial reserve army. Its production is included in that of the relative  surplus population, its necessity in theirs; along with the surplus population,  pauperism forms a condition of capitalist production, and of the capitalist  development of wealth. It enters into the faux frais of capitalist  production; but capital knows how to throw these, for the most part, from its  own shoulders on to those of the working class and the lower middle class.

The same causes which develop the expansive power of capital, develop  also the labour power at its disposal. The relative mass of the industrial  reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth. But the  greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour army, the greater  is the mass of a consolidated surplus population, whose misery is in inverse  ratio to its torment of labour. The more extensive, finally, the lazarus layers  of the working class, and the industrial reserve army, the greater is official  pauperism.

The  mechanism of capitalist production and accumulation constantly effects this  adjustment.

The fact that  the means of production, and the productiveness of labour, increase more  rapidly than the productive population, expresses itself, therefore,  capitalistically in the inverse form that the labouring population always  increases more rapidly than the conditions under which capital can employ this  increase for its own self-expansion.

2757,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"We saw in Part IV., when analysing the production of relative surplus-value:  within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness  of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer; all means  for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination  over, and exploitation of, the producers; they mutilate the labourer into a  fragment of a man, degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine,  destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil; they  estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process in the  same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power; they  distort the conditions under which he works, subject him during the labour  process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness; they transform his  life-time into working-time, and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of  the Juggernaut of capital. But all methods for the production of surplus-value  are at the same time methods of accumulation; and every extension of  accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods. It  follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates, the lot of the  labourer, be his payment high or low, must grow worse. The  law, finally, that always equilibrates the relative surplus population, or  industrial reserve army, to the extent and energy of accumulation, this law  rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did  Prometheus to the rock. It establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding  with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore,  at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil slavery, ignorance,  brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side  of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital.  This antagonistic character of  capitalistic accumulation is enunciated in various forms by political  economists, although by them it is confounded with phenomena, certainly to some  extent analogous, but nevertheless essentially distinct, and belonging to  pre-capitalistic modes of production.

Yet in this point of view, there is, in my opinion, a  very important sanitary context to be added. It must be remembered that  privation of food is very reluctantly borne, and that as a rule great poorness  of diet will only come when other privations have preceded it. Long before  insufficiency of diet is a matter of hygienic concern, long before the  physiologist would think of counting the grains of nitrogen and carbon which  intervene between life and starvation, the household will have been utterly  destitute of material comfort; clothing and fuel will have been even scantier  than food — against inclemencies of weather there will have been no  adequate protection — dwelling space will have been stinted to the degree  in which overcrowding produces or increases disease; of household utensils and  furniture there will have been scarcely any — even cleanliness will have been  found costly or difficult, and if there still be self-respectful endeavours to  maintain it, every such endeavour will represent additional pangs of hunger.  The home, too, will be where shelter can be cheapest bought; in quarters where  commonly there is least fruit of sanitary supervision, least drainage, least  scavenging, least suppression of public nuisances, least or worst water supply,  and, if in town, least light and air. Such are the sanitary  dangers to which poverty is almost certainly exposed, when it is poverty enough  to imply scantiness of food. And while the sum of them is of terrible magnitude  against life, the mere scantiness of food is in itself of very serious  moment.... These are painful reflections, especially when it is remembered that  the poverty to which they advert is not the deserved poverty of idleness. In  all cases it is the poverty of working populations. Indeed, as regards the  in-door operatives, the work which obtains the scanty pittance of food, is for  the most part excessively prolonged. Yet evidently it is only in a qualified  sense that the work can be deemed self-supporting....

It is otherwise with the  “housing of the poor.” Every unprejudiced observer sees that the  greater the centralisation of the means of production, the greater is the  corresponding heaping together of the labourers, within a given space; that  therefore the swifter capitalistic accumulation, the more miserable are the  dwellings of the working-people. “Improvements” of towns,  accompanying the increase of wealth, by the  demolition of badly built quarters, the erection of palaces for banks,  warehouses, &c., the widening of streets for business traffic, for the  carriages of luxury, and for the introduction of tramways, &c., drive away  the poor into even worse and more crowded hiding places. On the other hand,  every one knows that the dearness of dwellings is in inverse ratio to their  excellence, and that the mines of misery are exploited by house speculators  with more profit or less cost than ever were the mines of Potosi. The  antagonistic character of capitalist accumulation, and therefore of the  capitalistic relations of property generally,  is here so evident, that even the official English  reports on this subject teem with heterodox onslaughts on “property and  its rights.” With the development of industry, with the accumulation of  capital, with the growth and “improvement” of towns, the evil makes  such progress that the mere fear of contagious diseases which do not spare even  “respectability,” brought into existence from 1847 to 1864 no less  than 10 Acts of Parliament on sanitation, and that the frightened bourgeois in  some towns, as Liverpool, Glasgow, &c., took strenuous measures through  their municipalities.

Shortly before that time, the works for a  railway from Lewisham to Tunbridge were commenced here, and, in addition to the  principal works being in the immediate neighbourhood of this town, here was  also established the depôt for the whole of the works, so that a  large number of persons was of necessity employed here. As cottage  accommodation could not be obtained for them all, huts were built in several  places along the line of the works by the contractor, Mr. Jay, for their  especial occupation. These huts possessed no ventilation nor drainage, and,  besides, were necessarily over-crowded, because each occupant had to  accommodate lodgers, whatever the number in his own family might be, although  there were only two rooms to each tenement. The consequences were, according to  the medical report we received, that in the night-time these poor people were  compelled to endure all the horror of suffocation to avoid the pestiferous  smells arising from the filthy, stagnant water, and the privies close under  their windows. Complaints were at length made to the Nuisances Removal  Committee by a medical gentleman who had occasion to visit these huts, and he  spoke of their condition as dwellings in the most severe terms, and he  expressed his fears that some very serious consequences might ensue, unless  some sanitary measures were adopted. About a year ago, Mr. Jay promised to  appropriate a hut, to which persons in his employ, who were suffering from  contagious diseases, might at once be removed. He repeated that promise on the  23rd July last, but although since the date of the last Promise there have been  several cases of small-pox in his huts, and two deaths from the same disease,  yet he has taken no steps whatever to carry out his promise. On the 9th  September instant, Mr. Kelson, surgeon, reported to me further cases of  small-pox in the same huts, and he described their condition as most  disgraceful. I should add, for your (the Home  Secretary’s) information that an isolated house, called the Pest-house,  which is set apart for parishioners who might be suffering from infectious  diseases, has been continually occupied by such patients for many months past,  and is also now occupied; that in one family five children died from small-pox  and fever; that from the 1st April to the 1st September this year, a period of  five months, there have been no fewer than ten deaths from small-pox in the  parish, four of them being in the huts already referred to; that it is  impossible to ascertain the exact number of persons who have suffered from that  disease although they are known to be many, from the fact of the families  keeping it as private as possible.”  ","The

The price at which they buy their wages  was shown on an earlier page.   Here I merely cast a hurried glance over the conditions of their dwellings. As  a rule, the exploiter of a mine, whether its owner or his tenant, builds a  number of cottages for his hands. They receive cottages and coal for firing  “for nothing” — i.e., these form part of their  wages, paid in kind. Those who are not lodged in this way receive in  compensation £4 per annum. The mining districts attract with rapidity a large  population, made up of the miners themselves, and the artisans, shopkeepers,  &c., that group themselves around them. The ground-rents are high, as they  are generally where population is dense. The master tries, therefore, to run  up, within the smallest space possible at the mouth of the pit, just so many  cottages as are necessary to pack together his hands and their families. If new  mines are opened in the neighbourhood, or old ones are again set working, the  pressure increases. In the construction of the cottages, only  one point of view is of moment, the “abstinence” of the capitalist  from all expenditure that is not absolutely unavoidable.","The

The extreme badness is in the high  number of men found in one room, in the smallness of the ground-plot on which a  great number of houses are thrust, the want of water, the absence of privies,  and the frequent placing of one house on the top of another, or distribution  into flats, ... the lessee acts as if the whole colony were encamped, not  resident.”  ","The

It will be remembered that the year 1857  brought one of the great crises with which the industrial cycle periodically  ends. The next termination of the cycle was due in 1866. Already discounted in  the regular factory districts by the cotton famine, which threw much capital  from its wonted sphere into the great centres of the money-market, the crisis  assumed, at this time, an especially financial character. Its outbreak in 1866  was signalised by the failure of a gigantic London Bank, immediately followed  by the collapse of countless swindling companies. One of the great London  branches of industry involved in the catastrophe was iron shipbuilding. The magnates of this trade had not only over-produced beyond all  measure during the overtrading time, but they had, besides, engaged in enormous  contracts on the speculation that credit would be forthcoming to an equivalent  extent. Now, a terrible reaction set in, that even at this hour (the end of  March, 1867) continues in this and other London industries.  To show the condition of the  labourers, I quote the following from the circumstantial report of a  correspondent of the Morning Star, who, at the end of 1866, and  beginning of 1867, visited the chief centres of distress:","The
General Law of Capitalist Accumulation"
2836,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"“In the East End districts of Poplar, Millwall,  Greenwich, Deptford, Limehouse and Canning Town, at least 15,000 workmen  and their families were in a state of utter destitution, and 3,000  skilled mechanics were breaking stones in the workhouse yard (after distress of  over half a year’s duration).... I had great difficulty in reaching the  workhouse door, for a hungry crowd besieged it.... They were waiting for their  tickets, but the time had not yet arrived for the distribution. The yard was a  great square place with an open shed running all round it, and several large  heaps of snow covered the paving-stones in the middle. In the middle, also,  were little wicker-fenced spaces, like sheep pens, where in finer weather the  men worked; but on the day of my visit the pens were so snowed up that nobody  could sit in them. Men were busy, however, in the open shed breaking  paving-stones into macadam. Each man had a big paving-stone for a seat, and he  chipped away at the rime-covered granite with a big hammer until he had broken  up, and think! five bushels of it, and then he had done his day’s work,  and got his day’s pay — threepence and an allowance of food. In  another part of the yard was a rickety little wooden house, and when we opened  the door of it, we found it filled with men who were huddled together shoulder  to shoulder for the warmth of one another’s bodies and breath. They were  picking oakum and disputing the while as to which could work the longest on a  given quantity of food — for endurance was the point of honour. Seven  thousand ... in this one workhouse ... were recipients of relief ... many  hundreds of them ... it appeared, were, six or eight months ago, earning the  highest wages paid to artisans.... Their number would be more than doubled by  the count of those who, having exhausted all their savings, still refuse to  apply to the parish, because they have a little left to pawn. Leaving the  workhouse, I took a walk through the streets, mostly of little one-storey  houses, that abound in the neighbourhood of Poplar. My guide was a member of  the Committee of the Unemployed.... My first call was on an ironworker who had  been seven and twenty weeks out of employment. I found the man with his family  sitting in a little back room. The room was not bare of furniture, and there  was a fire in it. This was necessary to keep the naked feet of the young  children from getting frost bitten, for it was a bitterly cold day. On a tray  in front of the fire lay a quantity of oakum, which the wife and children were  picking in return for their allowance from the parish. The man worked in the  stone yard of the workhouse for a certain ration of food, and threepence per  day. He had now come home to dinner quite hungry, as he told us with a  melancholy smile, and his dinner consisted of a couple of slices of bread and  dripping, and a cup of milkless tea.... The next door at which we knocked was  opened by a middle-aged woman, who, without saying a word, led us into a little  back parlour, in which sat all her family, silent and fixedly staring at a  rapidly dying fire. Such desolation, such hopelessness wasabout these  people and their little room, as I should not care to witness again.  ‘Nothing have they done, sir,’ said the woman, pointing to her  boys, ‘for six and twenty weeks; and all our money gone — all the  twenty pounds that me and father saved when times were better, thinking it  would yield a little to keep us when we got past work. Look at it,’ she  said, almost fiercely, bringing out a bank-book with all its well kept entries  of money paid in, and money taken out, so that we could see how the little  fortune had begun with the first five shilling deposit, and had grown by little  and little to be twenty pounds, and how it had melted down again till the sum  in hand got from pounds to shillings, and the last entry made the book as  worthless as a blank sheet. This family received relief from the workhouse, and  it furnished them with just one scanty meal per day.... Our next visit was to  an iron labourer’s wife, whose husband had worked in the yards. We found  her ill from want of food, lying on a mattress in her clothes, and just covered  with a strip of carpet, for all the bedding had been pawned. Two wretched  children were tending her, themselves looking as much in need of nursing as  their mother. Nineteen weeks of enforced idleness had brought them to this  pass, and while the mother told the history of that bitter past, she moaned as  if all her faith in a future that should atone for it were dead.... On getting  outside a young fellow came running after us, and asked us to step inside his  house and see if anything could be done for him. A young wife, two pretty  children, a cluster of pawn-tickets, and a bare room were all he had to  show.” ","The

Assuredly no one was more  thoroughly initiated in the mysteries of this happiness than the late M.  Ducpétiaux, inspector-general of Belgian prisons and charitable institutions,  and member of the central commission of Belgian statistics. Let us take his  work: “Budgets économiques des classes ouvrières de la Belgique,”  Bruxelles, 1855. Here we find among other matters, a normal Belgian  labourer’s family, whose yearly income and expenditure he calculates on  very exact data, and whose conditions of nourishment are then compared with  those of the soldier, sailor, and prisoner. The family “consists of  father, mother, and four children.” Of these 6 persons “four may be  usefully employed the whole year through.” It is assumed that  “there is no sick person nor one incapable of work, among them,”  nor are there “expenses for religious, moral, and intellectual purposes,  except a very small sum for church sittings,” nor “contributions to  savings banks or benefit societies,” nor “expenses due to luxury or  the result of improvidence.” The father and eldest son, however, allow  themselves “the use of tobacco,” and on Sundays “go to the  cabaret,” for which a whole 86 centimes a week are reckoned.","The

Calculated at this rate, the resources of the family  would amount, at the maximum, to 1,068 francs a-year.... In the family ...  taken as typical we have calculated all possible resources. But in ascribing  wages to the mother of the family we raise the question of the direction of  the household. How will its internal economy be cared for? Who will look  after the young children? Who will get ready the meals, do the washing and  mending? This is the dilemma incessantly presented to the labourers.” ","The

The general average (of the cost of each prisoner in the different  prisons during the period 1847-1849), has been 63 centimes for all prisons.  This figure, compared with that of the daily maintenance of the labourer, shows  a difference of 13 centimes. It must be remarked further, that if in the  prisons it is necessary to set down in the account the expenses of  administration and surveillance, on the other hand, the prisoners have not to  pay for their lodging; that the purchases they make at the canteens are not  included in the expenses of maintenance, and that these expenses are greatly  lowered in consequence of the large number of persons that make up the  establishments, and of contracting for or buying wholesale, the food and other  things that enter into their consumption.... How comes it, however, that a  great number, we might say, a great majority, of labourers, live in a more  economical way? It is ... by adopting expedients, the secret of which only the  labourer knows; by reducing his daily rations; by substituting rye-bread for  wheat; by eating less meat, or even none at all, and the same with butter and  condiments; by contenting themselves with one or two rooms where the family is  crammed together, where boys and girls sleep side by side, often on the same  pallet; by economy of clothing, washing, decency; by giving up the Sunday  diversions; by, in short, resigning themselves to the most painful privations.  Once arrived at this extreme limit, the least rise in the price of food,  stoppage of work, illness, increases the labourer’s distress and  determines his complete ruin; debts accumulate, credit fails, the most  necessary clothes and furniture are pawned, and finally, the family asks to be  enrolled on the list of paupers.” (Ducpétiaux, l. c., pp. 151, 154,  155.)","The

The nominal wages rose in  consequence partly of the bank-note depreciation, partly of a rise in the price  of the primary means of subsistence independent of this depreciation. But the  actual wage-variation can be evidenced in a very simple way, without entering  into details that are here unnecessary. The Poor Law and its administration  were in 1795 and 1814 the same. It will be remembered how this law was carried  out in the country districts: in the form of alms the parish made up the  nominal wage to the nominal sum required for the simple vegetation of the  labourer. The ratio between the wages paid by the farmer, and the wage-deficit  made good by the parish, shows us two things. First, the falling of wages below  their minimum; second, the degree in which the agricultural labourer was a  compound of wage labourer and pauper, or the degree in which he had been turned  into a serf of his parish. Let us take one county that represents the average  condition of things in all counties. In Northamptonshire, in 1795, the average  weekly wage was 7s. 6d.; the total yearly  expenditure of a family of 6 persons, £36 12s. 5d.; their total income, £29  18s.; deficit made good by the parish, £6 14s. 5d. In 1814, in the same county,  the weekly wage was 12s. 2d.; the total yearly expenditure of a family of 5  persons, £54 18s. 4d.; their total income, £36, 2s.; deficit made good by the  parish, £18 6s. 4d.

It is an  old English proverb that “when thieves fall out, honest men come by their  own,” and, in fact, the noisy, passionate quarrel between the two  fractions of the ruling class about the question, which of the two exploited  the labourers the more shamefully, was on each hand the midwife of the truth.  Earl Shaftesbury, then Lord Ashley, was commander-in-chief in the aristocratic,  philanthropic, anti-factory campaign. He was, therefore, in 1845, a favourite  subject in the revelations of the Morning Chronicle on the condition  of the agricultural labourers. This journal, then the most important Liberal  organ, sent special commissioners into the agricultural districts, who did not  content themselves with mere general descriptions and statistics, but published  the names both of the labouring families examined and of their landlords. The  following list gives the wages paid in three villages in the neighbourhood of  Blanford, Wimbourne, and Poole. The villages are the property of Mr. G. Bankes  and of the Earl of Shaftesbury.

Whether he shall find house-room on the land which he  contributes to till, whether the house-room which he gets shall be human or  swinish, whether he shall have the little space of garden that so vastly  lessens the pressure of his poverty — all this does not depend on his  willingness and ability to pay reasonable rent for the decent accommodation he  requires, but depends on the use which others may see fit to make of their  ‘right to do as they will with their own.’ However large may be a  farm, there is no law that a certain proportion of labourers’ dwellings  (much less of decent dwellings) shall be  upon it; nor does any law reserve for the labourer ever so little right in that  soil to which his industry is as needful as sun and rain....

He is the recruiting-sergeant for the  gang, which works under him, not under the farmer. He generally arranges with  the latter for piece-work, and his income, which on the average is not very  much above that of an ordinary agricultural labourer,  depends almost entirely upon the  dexterity with which he manages to extract within the shortest time  the greatest possible amount of labour from his gang. The farmers have  discovered that women work steadily only under the direction of men, but that  women and children, once set going, impetuously spend their life-force —  as Fourier knew — while the adult male labourer is shrewd enough to  economise his as much as he can. The gang-master goes from one farm to another,  and thus employs his gang from 6 to 8 months in the year. Employment by him is,  therefore, much more lucrative and more certain for the labouring families,  than employment by the individual farmer, who only employs children  occasionally. This circumstance so completely rivets his influence in the open  villages that children are generally only to be hired through his  instrumentality.

He is a democratic emperor, or  a kind of Pied Piper of Hamelin. He must therefore be popular with his  subjects, and he binds them to himself by the charms of the gipsy life under  his direction. Coarse freedom, a noisy jollity, and obscenest impudence give  attractions to the gang. Generally the gangmaster pays up in a public house;  then he returns home at the head of the procession reeling drunk, propped up  right and left by a stalwart virago, while children and young persons bring up  the rear, boisterous, and singing chaffing and bawdy songs. On the return  journey what Fourier calls “phanerogamie,” is the order of the day.  The getting with child of girls of 13 and 14 by their male companions of the  same age, is common.

Nevertheless, with the fall in numbers of the  population, rents and farmers’ profits rose, although the latter not as  steadily as the former. The reason of this is easily comprehensible.

The surplus-produce increased, although the total  produce, of which it formed a fraction, decreased.

To the wealth of the country it did not the slightest damage.  The exodus of the next 20 years, an exodus still constantly increasing, did  not, as, e.g., the Thirty Years’ War, decimate, along with the  human beings, their means of production. Irish genius discovered an altogether  new way of spiriting a poor people thousands of miles away from the scene of  its misery. The exiles transplanted to the United States, send home sums of  money every year as travelling expenses for those left behind. Every troop that  emigrates one year, draws another after it the next. Thus, instead of costing  Ireland anything, emigration forms one of the most lucrative branches  of its export trade. Finally, it is a systematic process, which does not simply  make a passing gap in the population, but sucks out of it every year more  people than are replaced by the births, so that the absolute level of the  population falls year by year.

General Law of Capitalist Accumulation"
2920,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm,"What were the consequences for the Irish labourers left behind and freed  from the surplus population? That the relative surplus population is today as  great as before 1846; that wages are just as low, that the oppression of the  labourers has increased, that misery is forcing the country towards a new  crisis. The facts are simple. The revolution in agriculture  has kept pace with emigration. The production of relative surplus population  has more than kept pace with the absolute depopulation. A glance at table C.  shows that the change of arable to pasture land must work yet more acutely in  Ireland than in England. In England the cultivation of green crops increases  with the breeding of cattle; in Ireland, it decreases. Whilst a large number of  acres, that were formerly tilled, lie idle or are turned permanently into  grass-land, a great part of the waste land and peat bogs that were unused  formerly, become of service for the extension of cattle-breeding. The smaller  and medium farmers — I reckon among these all who do not cultivate more  than 100 acres — still make up about 8/10ths of the whole number.  They are one after the other, and  with a degree of force unknown before, crushed by the competition of an  agriculture managed by capital, and therefore they continually furnish new  recruits to the class of wage labourers. The one great industry of Ireland,  linen-manufacture, requires relatively few adult men and only employs  altogether, in spite of its expansion since the price of cotton rose in  1861-1866, a comparatively insignificant part of the population. Like all other  great modern industries, it constantly produces, by incessant fluctuations, a  relative surplus population within its own sphere, even with an absolute  increase in the mass of human beings absorbed by it. The misery of the  agricultural population forms the pedestal for gigantic shirt-factories, whose  armies of labourers are, for the most part, scattered over the country. Here,  we encounter again the system described above of domestic industry, which in  underpayment and overwork, possesses its own systematic means for creating  supernumerary labourers. Finally, although the depopulation has not such  destructive consequences as would result in a country with fully developed  capitalistic production, it does not go on without constant reaction  upon the home-market. The gap which emigration causes here, limits not only the  local demand for labour, but also the incomes of small shopkeepers, artisans,  tradespeople generally. Hence the diminution in incomes between £60 and £100 in  Table E. ","The

According to them the rate of wages in  the country, still very low, has within the last 20 years risen 50-60 per  cent., and stands now, on the average, at 6s. to 9s. per week.

The child of 12 takes care of the little children all the day,  and we get nothing till breakfast at eight. At eight we go home. We get tea once a week; at other times we get stirabout,  sometimes of oat-meal, sometimes of Indian meal, as we are able to get it. In  the winter we get a little sugar and water to our Indian meal.

But the lion’s share, which an  inconceivably small number of land magnates in England, Scotland and Ireland  swallow up of the yearly national rental, is so monstrous that the wisdom of  the English State does not think fit to afford the same statistical materials  about the distribution of rents as about the distribution of profits. Lord  Dufferin is one of those land magnates. That rent-rolls and profits can ever be  “excessive,” or that their plethora is in any way connected with  plethora of the people’s misery is, of course, an idea as  “disreputable” as “unsound.” He keeps to facts. The  fact is that, as the Irish population diminishes, the Irish rent-rolls swell;  that depopulation benefits the landlords, therefore also benefits the soil,  and, therefore, the people, that mere accessory of the soil. He declares,  therefore, that Ireland is still over-populated, and the stream of emigration  still flows too lazily. To be perfectly happy, Ireland must get rid of at least  one-third of a million of labouring men. Let no man imagine that this lord,  poetic into the bargain, is a physician of the school of Sangrado, who as often  as he did not find his patient better, ordered phlebotomy and again phlebotomy,  until the patient lost his sickness at the same time as his blood. Lord  Dufferin demands a new blood-letting of one-third of a million only, instead of  about two millions; in fact, without the getting rid of these, the millennium  in Erin is not to be.

If the reader reminds me of Malthus, whose “Essay on Population”  appeared in 1798, I remind him that this work in its first form is nothing more  than a schoolboyish, superficial plagiary of De Foe, Sir James Steuart,  Townsend, Franklin, Wallace, &c., and does not contain a single sentence  thought out by himself. The great sensation this pamphlet caused, was due  solely to party interest. The French Revolution had found passionate defenders  in the United Kingdom; the “principle of population,” slowly worked  out in the eighteenth century, and then, in the midst of a great social crisis,  proclaimed with drums and trumpets as the infallible antidote to the teachings  of Condorcet, &c., was greeted with jubilance by the English oligarchy as  the great destroyer of all hankerings after human development. Malthus, hugely  astonished at his success, gave himself to stuffing into his book materials  superficially compiled, and adding to it new matter, not discovered but annexed  by him. Note further: Although Malthus was a parson of the English State  Church, he had taken the monastic vow of celibacy — one of the conditions  of holding a Fellowship in Protestant Cambridge University: “Socios  collegiorum maritos esse non permittimus, sed statim postquam quis uxorem  duxerit socius collegii desinat esse.” (“Reports of Cambridge  University Commission,” p. 172.) This circumstance favourably  distinguishes Malthus from the other Protestant parsons, who have shuffled off  the command enjoining celibacy of the priesthood and have taken, “Be  fruitful and multiply,” as their special Biblical mission in such a  degree that they generally contribute to the increase of population to a really  unbecoming extent, whilst they preach at the same time to the labourers the  “principle of population.” It is characteristic that the economic  fall of man, the Adam’s apple, the urgent appetite, “the checks  which tend to blunt the shafts of Cupid,” as Parson Townsend waggishly  puts it, that this delicate question was and is monopolised by the Reverends of  Protestant Theology, or rather of the Protestant Church. With the exception of  the Venetian monk, Ortes, an original and clever writer, most of the population  theory teachers are Protestant parsons. For instance, Bruckner, “Théorie  du Système animal,” Leyde, 1767, in which the whole subject of the modern  population theory is exhausted, and to which the passing quarrel between  Quesnay and his pupil, the elder Mirabeau, furnished ideas on the same topic;  then Parson Wallace, Parson Townsend, Parson Malthus and his pupil, the  arch-Parson Thomas Chalmers, to say nothing of lesser reverend scribblers in  this line. Originally, Political Economy was studied by philosophers like  Hobbes, Locke, Hume; by businessmen and statesmen, like Thomas More, Temple,  Sully, De Witt, North, Law, Vanderlint, Cantillon, Franklin; and especially,  and with the greatest success, by medical men like Petty, Barbon, Mandeville,  Quesnay. Even in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Rev. Mr. Tucker, a  notable economist of his time, excused himself for meddling with the things of  Mammon. Later on, and in truth with this very “Principle of  population,” struck the hour of the Protestant parsons. Petty, who  regarded the population as the basis of wealth, and was, like Adam Smith, an  outspoken foe to parsons, says, as if he had a presentiment of their bungling  interference, “that Religion best flourishes when the Priests are most  mortified, as was before said of the Law, which best flourisheth when lawyers  have least to do.” He advises the Protestant priests, therefore, if they,  once for all, will not follow the Apostle Paul and “mortify”  themselves by celibacy, “not to breed more Churchmen than the Benefices,  as they now stand shared out, will receive, that is to say, if there be places  for about twelve thousand in England and Wales, it will not be safe to breed up  24,000 ministers, for then the twelve thousand which are unprovided for, will  seek ways how to get themselves a livelihood, which they cannot do more easily  than by persuading the people that the twelve thousand incumbents do poison or  starve their souls, and misguide them in their way to Heaven.” (Petty:  “A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions,” London, 1667, p. 57.) Adam  Smith’s position with the Protestant priesthood of his time is shown by  the following. In “A Letter to A. Smith, L.L.D. On the Life, Death, and  Philosophy of his Friend, David Hume. By one of the People called  Christians,” 4th Edition, Oxford, 1784, Dr. Horne, Bishop of Norwich,  reproves Adam Smith, because in a published letter to Mr. Strahan, he  “embalmed his friend David” (sc. Hume); because he told the world  how “Hume amused himself on his deathbed with Lucian and Whist,”  and because he even had the impudence to write of Hume: “I have always  considered him, both in his life-time and since his death, as approaching as  nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as, perhaps, the  nature of human frailty will permit.” The bishop cries out, in a passion:  “Is it right in you, Sir, to hold up to our view as ‘perfectly wise  and virtuous,’ the character and conduct of one, who seems to  have been possessed with an incurable antipathy to all that is called  Religion; and who strained every nerve to explode, suppress and  extirpate the spirit of it among men, that its very name, if he could effect  it, might no more be had in remembrance?” (l. c., p. 8.) “But let  not the lovers of truth be discouraged. Atheism cannot be of long  continuance.” (P. 17.) Adam Smith, “had the atrocious wickedness to  propagate atheism through the land (viz., by his “Theory of Moral  Sentiments”). Upon the whole, Doctor, your meaning is good; but I think  you will not succeed this time. You would persuade us, by the example of  David Hume, Esq., that atheism is the only cordial for low spirits,  and the proper antidote against the fear of death.... You may smile over  Babylon in ruins and congratulate the hardened Pharaoh on his  overthrow in the Red Sea.” (l. c., pp. 21, 22.) One orthodox individual,  amongst Adam Smith’s college friends, writes after his death:  “Smith’s well-placed affection for Hume ... hindered him from being  a Christian.... When he met with honest men whom he liked ... he would believe  almost anything they said. Had he been a friend of the worthy ingenious Horrox  he would have believed that the moon some times disappeared in a clear sky  without the interposition of a cloud.... He approached to republicanism in his  political principles.” (“The Bee.” By James Anderson, 18  Vols., Vol. 3, pp. 166, 165, Edinburgh, 1791-93.)

Were it true  that the proportion between these two sorts of capital is the same at all  times, and in all circumstances, then, indeed, it follows that the number of  labourers employed is in proportion to the wealth of the state. But such a  proposition has not the semblance of probability. As arts are cultivated, and  civilisation is extended, fixed capital bears a larger and larger proportion to  circulating capital. The amount of fixed capital employed in the production of  a piece of British muslin is at least a hundred, probably a thousand times  greater than that employed in a similar piece of Indian muslin. And the  proportion of circulating capital is a hundred or thousand times less ... the  whole of the annual savings, added to the fixed capital, would have no effect  in increasing the demand for labour.” (John Barton, “Observations  on the Circumstances which Influence the Condition of the Labouring Classes of  Society.” London, 1817, pp. 16, 17.) “The same cause which may  increase the net revenue of the country may at the same time render the  population redundant, and deteriorate the condition of the labourer.”  (Ricardo, l. c., p. 469.) With increase of capital, “the demand  will rise ... not in proportion to the accumulation  of the general capital. ... Every augmentation, therefore, in the national  stock destined for reproduction, comes, in the progress of society, to have  less and less influence upon the condition of the labourer.” (Ramsay, l.  c., pp. 90, 91.)","The

Even in the cotton famine of 1863 we find, in a  pamphlet of the operative cotton-spinners of Blackburn, fierce denunciations of  overwork, which, in consequence of the Factory Acts, of course only affected  adult male labourers. “The adult operatives at this mill have been asked  to work from 12 to 13 hours per day, while there are hundreds who are compelled  to be idle who would willingly work partial time, in order to maintain their  families and save their brethren from a premature grave through being  overworked.... We,” it goes on to say, “would ask if the practice  of working overtime by a number of hands, is likely to create a good feeling  between masters and servants. Those who are worked overtime feel the injustice  equally with those who are condemned to forced idleness. There is in the  district almost sufficient work to give to all partial employment if fairly  distributed. We are only asking what is right in requesting the masters  generally to pursue a system of short hours, particularly until a better state  of things begins to dawn upon us, rather than to work a portion of the hands  overtime, while others, for want of work, are compelled to exist upon  charity.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., Oct. 31, 1863,” p. 8.)  The author of the “Essay on Trade and Commerce” grasps the effect  of a relative surplus population on the employed labourers with his usual  unerring bourgeois instinct. “Another cause of idleness in this kingdom  is the want of a sufficient number of labouring hands .... Whenever from an  extraordinary demand for manufactures, labour grows scarce, the labourers feel  their own consequence, and will make their masters feel it likewise — it  is amazing; but so depraved are the dispositions of these people, that in such  cases a set of workmen have combined to distress the employer by idling a whole  day together.” (“Essay, &c.,” pp. 27, 28.)

The decrease of the middle-class farmers can be seen  especially in the census category: “Farmer’s son, grandson,  brother, nephew, daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece""; in a word, the  members of his own family, employed by the farmer. This category numbered, in  1851, 216,851 persons; in 1861, only 176,151.

Arthur Young  in his “Tour in Ireland,” at the beginning of this century, already  noticed the better nourishment of the latter. The reason is simply this, that  the poor Irish farmer is incomparably more humane than the rich English. As  regards Wales, that which is said in the text holds only for the southwest. All  the doctors there agree that the increase of the death-rate through  tuberculosis, scrofula, etc., increases in intensity with the deterioration of  the physical condition of the population, and all ascribe this deterioration to  poverty. “His (the farm labourer’s) keep is reckoned at about five  pence a day, but in many districts it was said to be of much less cost to the  farmer” .... “A morsel of the salt meat or  bacon, ... salted and dried to the texture of mahogany, and hardly worth the  difficult process of assimilation ... is used to flavour a large quantity of  broth or gruel, of meal and leeks, and day after day this is the  labourer’s dinner.” The advance of industry resulted for him, in  this harsh and damp climate, in “the abandonment of the solid homespun  clothing in favour of the cheap and so-called cotton goods,” and of  stronger drinks for so-called tea. “The agriculturist, after several  hours’ exposure to wind and rain, pins his cottage to sit by a fire of  peat or of balls of clay and small coal kneaded together, from which volumes of  carbonic and sulphurous acids are poured forth. His walls are of mud and  stones, his floor the bare earth which was there before the hut was built, his  roof a mass of loose and sodden thatch. Every crevice is topped to maintain  warmth, and in an atmosphere of diabolic odour, with a mud floor, with his only  clothes drying on his back, he often sups and sleeps with his wife and  children. Obstetricians who have passed parts of the night in such cabins have  described how they found their feet sinking in the mud of the floor, and they  were forced (easy task) to drill a hole through the wall to effect a little  private respiration. It was attested by numerous witnesses in various grades of  life, that to these insanitary influences, and many more, the underfed peasant  was nightly exposed, and of the result, a debilitated and scrofulous people,  there was no want of evidence.... The statements of the relieving officers of  Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire show in a striking way the same state of  things. There is besides “a plague more horrible still, the great number  of idiots.” Now a word on the climatic conditions. “A strong  south-west wind blows over the whole country for 8 or 9 months in the year,  bringing with it torrents of rain, which discharge principally upon the western  slopes of the hills. Trees are rare, except in sheltered places, and where not  protected, are blown out of all shape. The cottages generally crouch under some  bank, or often in a ravine or quarry, and none but the smallest sheep and  native cattle can live on the pastures.... The young people migrate to the  eastern mining districts of Glamorgan and Monmouth. Carmarthenshire is the  breeding ground of the mining population and their hospital. The population can  therefore barely maintain its numbers.” Thus in Cardiganshire:","The

In order to understand that which follows, we must  remember that “Close Villages” are those whose owners are one or  two large landlords. “Open villages,” those whose soil belongs to  many smaller landlords. It is in the latter that building speculators can build  cottages and lodging-houses.","The

A show-village of this kind looks very nice, but  is as unreal as the villages that Catherine II. saw on her journey to the  Crimea. In recent times the shepherd also has often been banished from these  show-villages; e.g., near Market Harboro is sheep-farm of about 500  acres, which only employs the labour of one man. To reduce the long trudges  over these wide plains, the beautiful pastures of Leicester and Northampton,  the shepherd used to get a cottage on the farm. Now they give him a thirteenth  shilling a week for lodging, that he must find far away in an open village.","The

Very often the  beerseller or grocer of the village is at the same time the letter of its  houses. In this case the agricultural labourer finds in him a second master,  besides the farmer. He must be his customer as well as his tenant. “The  hind with his 10s. a week, minus a rent of £4 a year ... is obliged to buy at  the seller’s own terms, his modicum of tea, sugar, flour, soap, candles,  and beer.” (l. c., p. 132.) These open villages form, in fact, the  “penal settlements” of the English agricultural proletariat. Many  of the cottages are simply lodging-houses, through which all the rabble of the  neighbourhood passes. The country labourer and his family who had often, in a  way truly wonderful, preserved, under the foulest conditions, a thoroughness  and purity of character, go, in these, utterly to the devil. It is, of course,  the fashion amongst the aristocratic shylocks to shrug their shoulders  pharisaically at the building speculators, the small landlords, and the open  villages. They know well enough that their “close villages” and  “show-villages” are the birth-places of the open villages, and  could not exist without them. “The labourers ... were it not for the  small owners, would, for by far the most part, have to sleep under the trees of  the farms on which they work.” (l. c., p. 135.) The system of  “open” and “closed” villages obtains in all the Midland  counties and throughout the East of England.","The

A member of the rural police who  had for many years been a detective in the worst quarters of London, says of  the girls of his village: “their boldness and shamelessness I never saw  equalled during some years of police life and detective duty in the worst parts  of London ....

He is not a slave, but a soldier of peace,  and deserves his place in married men’s quarters to be provided by the  landlord, who has claimed a power of enforced labour similar to that the  country demands of the soldier. He no more receives market-price for his work  than does the soldier. Like the soldier he is caught young, ignorant, knowing  only his own trade, and his own locality. Early marriage and the operation of  the various laws of settlement affect the one as enlistment and the Mutiny Act  affect the other.” (Dr. Hunter, l. c., p. 132.) Sometimes an  exceptionally soft-hearted landlord relents as the solitude he has created.  “It is a melancholy thing to stand alone in one’s country,”  said Lord Leicester, when complimented on the completion of Hookham. “I  look around and not a house is to be seen but mine. I am the giant of Giant  Castle, and have eat up all my neighbours.” ","The

A similar movement is seen during the last ten  years in France; in proportion as capitalist production there takes possession  of agriculture, it drives the “surplus” agricultural population  into the towns. Here also we find deterioration in the housing and other  conditions at the source of the surplus population.

For the  “labour question” in English agricultural districts, differently  from the rest of the civilised world, means the landlords’ and  farmers’ question, viz., how is it possible, despite an always  increasing exodus of the agricultural folk, to keep up a sufficient relative  surplus population in the country, and by means of it keep the wages of the  agricultural labourer at a minimum?","The

The “Public Health Report,” where in  dealing with the subject of children’s mortality, the gang-system is  treated in passing, remains unknown to the press, and, therefore, to the  English public. On the other hand, the last report of the “Child. Empl.  Comm.” afforded the press sensational copy always welcome. Whilst the  Liberal press asked how the fine gentlemen and ladies, and the well-paid clergy  of the State Church, with whom Lincolnshire swarms, could allow such a system  to arise on their estates, under their very eyes, they who send out expressly  missions to the Antipodes, “for the improvement of the morals of South  Sea Islanders” — the more refined press confined itself to  reflections on the coarse degradation of the agricultural population who are  capable of selling their children into such slavery! Under the accursed  conditions to which these “delicate” people condemn the  agricultural labourer, it would not be surprising if he ate his own children.  What is really wonderful is the healthy integrity of character, he has, in  great part, retained. The official reports prove that the parents, even in the  gang districts, loathe the gang-system. “There is much in the evidence  that shows that the parents of the children would, in many instances, be glad  to be aided by the requirements of a legal obligation, to resist the pressure  and the temptations to which they are often subject. They are liable to be  urged, at times by the parish officers, at times by employers, under threats of  being themselves discharged, to be taken to work at an age when ... school  attendance ... would be manifestly to their greater advantage.... All that time  and strength wasted; all the suffering from extra and unprofitable fatigue  produced to the labourer and to his children; every instance in which the  parent may have traced the moral ruin of his child to the undermining of  delicacy by the over-crowding of cottages, or to the contaminating influences  of the public gang, must have been so many incentives to feelings in the minds  of the labouring poor which can be well understood, and which it would be  needless to particularise. They must be conscious that much bodily and mental  pain has thus been inflicted upon them from causes for which they were in no  way answerable; to which, had it been in their power, they would have in no way  consented; and against which they were powerless to struggle.” (l. c., p.  xx., § 82, and xxiii., n. 96.)","The

How the famine and its consequences have been  deliberately made the most of, both by the individual landlords and by the  English legislature, to forcibly carry out the agricultural revolution and to  thin the population of Ireland down to the proportion satisfactory to the  landlords, I shall show more fully in Vol. III. of this work, in the section on  landed property. There also I return to the condition of the small farmers and  the agricultural labourers. At present, only one quotation. Nassau W. Senior  says, with other things, in his posthumous work, “Journals, Conversations  and Essays relating to Ireland.” 2 vols. London, 1868; Vol. II., p. 282.  “Well,” said Dr. G., “we have got our Poor Law and it is a  great instrument for giving the victory to the landlords. Another, and a still  more powerful instrument is emigration.... No friend to Ireland can wish the  war to be prolonged   — still less, that it should end by the victory of the tenants. The  sooner it is over — the sooner Ireland becomes a grazing country, with  the comparatively thin population which a grazing country requires, the better  for all classes.” The English Corn Laws of 1815 secured Ireland the  monopoly of the free importation of corn into Great Britain. They favoured  artificially, therefore, the cultivation of corn. With the abolition of the  Corn Laws in 1846, this monopoly was suddenly removed. Apart from all other  circumstances, this event alone was sufficient to give a great impulse to the  turning of Irish arable into pasture land, to the concentration of farms, and to  the eviction of small cultivators. After the fruitfulness of the Irish soil had  been praised from 1815 to 1846, and proclaimed loudly as by Nature herself  destined for the cultivation of wheat, English agronomists, economists,  politicians, discover suddenly that it is good for nothing but to produce  forage. M. Léonce de Lavergne has hastened to repeat this on the other side of  the Channel. It takes a “serious” man, à la Lavergne, to be caught  by such childishness. ","The

But the accumulation of capital presupposes surplus-value; surplus-value presupposes capitalistic production; capitalistic production presupposes the pre-existence of considerable masses of capital and of labour power in the hands of producers of commodities. The whole movement, therefore, seems to turn in a vicious circle, out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation (previous accumulation of Adam Smith) preceding capitalistic accumulation; an accumulation not the result of the capitalistic mode of production, but its starting point.","The
Secret of Primitive Accumulation"
3101,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm,"This primitive accumulation plays in Political Economy about the same part as original sin in theology. Adam bit the apple, and thereupon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living. The legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow; but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential. Never mind! Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property. M. Thiers, e.g., had the assurance to repeat it with all the solemnity of a statesman to the French people, once so spirituel. But as soon as the question of property crops up, it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages and for all stages of development. In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part. In the tender annals of Political Economy, the idyllic reigns from time immemorial. Right and “labour” were from all time the sole means of enrichment, the present year of course always excepted. As a matter of fact, the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic.","The

3102,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm,"In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence. They want transforming into capital. But this transformation itself can only take place under certain circumstances that centre in this, viz., that two very different kinds of commodity-possessors must come face to face and into contact; on the one hand, the owners of money, means of production, means of subsistence, who are eager to increase the sum of values they possess, by buying other people’s labour power; on the other hand, free labourers, the sellers of their own labour power, and therefore the sellers of labour. Free labourers, in the double sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production, as in the case of slaves, bondsmen, &c., nor do the means of production belong to them, as in the case of peasant-proprietors; they are, therefore, free from, unencumbered by, any means of production of their own. With this polarization of the market for commodities, the fundamental conditions of capitalist production are given. The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realize their labour. As soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale. The process, therefore, that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production; a process that transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production into capital, on the other, the immediate producers into wage labourers. The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the prehistoric stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it.","The

To become a free seller of labour power, who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market, he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds, their rules for apprentices and journeymen, and the impediments of their labour regulations. Hence, the historical movement which changes the producers into wage-workers, appears, on the one hand, as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds, and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But, on the other hand, these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements. And the history of this, their expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire.","The

In this respect, their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives, and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free development of production and the free exploitation of man by man. The chevaliers d’industrie, however, only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly innocent. They have risen by means as vile as those by which the Roman freedman once on a time made himself the master of his patronus.","The

3106,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm,"The starting point of the development that gave rise to the wage labourer as well as to the capitalist, was the servitude of the labourer. The advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude, in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation. To understand its march, we need not go back very far. Although we come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the 14th or 15th century, sporadically, in certain towns of the Mediterranean, the capitalistic era dates from the 16th century. Wherever it appears, the abolition of serfdom has been long effected, and the highest development of the middle ages, the existence of sovereign towns, has been long on the wane.","The

The expropriation of the agricultural producer, of the peasant, from the soil, is the basis of the whole process. The history of this expropriation, in different countries, assumes different aspects, and runs through its various phases in different orders of succession, and at different periods. In England alone, which we take as our example, has it the classic form. ","The

The serf was emancipated in that country before he had acquired any prescriptive right to the soil. His emancipation at once transformed him into a free proletarian, who, moreover, found his master ready waiting for him in the towns, for the most part handed down as legacies from the Roman time. When the revolution of the world-market, about the end of the 15th century, annihilated Northern Italy’s commercial supremacy, a movement in the reverse direction set in. The labourers of the towns were driven en masse into the country, and gave an impulse, never before seen, to the petite culture, carried on in the form of gardening.","The

The immense majority of the  population  Although, therefore, the English  land, after the Norman Conquest, was distributed in gigantic  baronies, one of which often included some 900 of the old  Anglo-Saxon lordships, it was bestrewn with small peasant  properties, only here and there interspersed with great  seignorial domains. Such conditions, together with the  prosperity of the towns so characteristic of the 15th  century, allowed of that wealth of the people which  Chancellor Fortescue so eloquently paints in his “Laudes  legum Angliae;” but it excluded the possibility of  capitalistic wealth.","Expropriation

3117,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm,"The prelude of the revolution that laid the foundation of  the capitalist mode of production, was played in the last  third of the 15th, and the first decade of the 16th century.  A mass of free proletarians was hurled on the labour market  by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers, who, as  Sir James Steuart well says, “everywhere uselessly filled  house and castle.” Although the royal power, itself a  product of bourgeois development, in its strife after  absolute sovereignty forcibly hastened on the dissolution of  these bands of retainers, it was by no means the sole cause  of it. In insolent conflict with king and parliament, the  great feudal lords created an incomparably larger  proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from  the land, to which the latter had the same feudal right as  the lord himself, and by the usurpation of the common lands.  The rapid rise of the Flemish wool manufactures, and the  corresponding rise in the price of wool in England, gave the  direct impulse to these evictions. The old nobility had been  devoured by the great feudal wars. The new nobility was the  child of its time, for which money was the power of all  powers. Transformation of arable land into sheep-walks was,  therefore, its cry. Harrison, in his “Description of  England, prefixed to Holinshed’s Chronicles,” describes how  the expropriation of small peasants is ruining the country.   “What care our great encroachers?” The dwellings of the  peasants and the cottages of the labourers were razed to the  ground or doomed to decay. “If,” says Harrison, “the old  records of euerie manour be sought... it will soon appear that  in some manour seventeene, eighteene, or twentie  houses are shrunk... that England  was neuer less furnished with people than at the present...  Of cities and townes either utterly decaied or more than a  quarter or half diminished, though some one be a little  increased here or there; of townes pulled downe for  sheepe-walks, and no more but the lordships now standing in  them... I could saie somewhat.” The complaints of these old  chroniclers are always exaggerated, but they reflect  faithfully the impression made on contemporaries by the  revolution in the conditions of production. A comparison of  the writings of Chancellor Fortescue and Thomas More reveals  the gulf between the 15th and 16th century. As Thornton  rightly has it, the English working class was precipitated  without any transition from its golden into its iron age.","Expropriation

3118,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm,"Legislation was terrified at this revolution. It did not  yet stand on that height of civilization where the “wealth  of the nation” (i.e., the formation of capital, and the  reckless exploitation and impoverishing of the mass of the  people) figure as the ultima Thule of all  state-craft.  In his history of Henry VII., Bacon says:   “Inclosures at that time (1489) began to be more frequent,  whereby arable land (which could not be manured without  people and families) was turned into pasture, which was  easily rid by a few herdsmen; and tenancies for years,  lives, and at will (whereupon much of the yeomanry lived)  were turned into demesnes. This bred a decay of people, and  (by consequence) a decay of towns, churches, tithes, and the  like... In remedying of this inconvenience the king’s  wisdom was admirable, and the parliament’s at that time...  they took a course to take away depopulating enclosures, and  depopulating pasturage.” An Act of Henry VII., 1489, cap.  19, forbad the destruction of all “houses of husbandry” to  which at least 20 acres of land belonged. By an Act, 25  Henry VIII., the same law was renewed. It recites, among  other things, that many farms and large flocks of cattle,  especially of sheep, are concentrated in the hands of a few  men, whereby the rent of land has much risen and tillage has  fallen off, churches and houses have been pulled down, and  marvellous numbers of people have been deprived of the means  wherewith to maintain themselves and their families.  The Act, therefore, ordains  the rebuilding of the decayed farmsteads, and fixes a  proportion between corn land and pasture land, &c. An  Act of 1533 recites that some owners possess 24,000 sheep,  and limits the number to be owned to 2,000.      ","Expropriation

The  Catholic church was, at the time of the Reformation, feudal  proprietor of a great part of the English land. The  suppression of the monasteries, &c., hurled their  inmates into the proletariat. The estates of the church were  to a large extent given away to rapacious royal favourites,  or sold at a nominal price to speculating farmers and  citizens, who drove out, en masse, the hereditary  sub-tenants and threw their holdings into one.

They had formed the  backbone of Cromwell’s strength, and, even according to the  confession of Macaulay, stood in favourable contrast to the  drunken squires and to their servants, the country clergy,  who had to marry their masters’ cast-off mistresses. About  1750, the yeomanry had disappeared,  and so had, in the last decade  of the 18th century, the last trace of the common land of  the agricultural labourer.

Besides, the new landed  aristocracy was the natural ally of the new bankocracy, of  the newly-hatched haute finance, and of the large  manufacturers, then depending on protective duties. The  English bourgeoisie acted for its own interest quite as  wisely as did the Swedish bourgeoisie who, reversing the  process, hand in hand with their economic allies, the  peasantry, helped the kings in the forcible resumption of  the Crown lands from the oligarchy.

But, at that time, the process was carried on by  means of individual acts of violence against which  legislation, for a hundred and fifty years, fought in vain.

In the south of England certain landed proprietors  and well-to-do farmers put their heads together and  propounded ten questions as to the right interpretation of  the poor-law of Elizabeth. These they laid before a  celebrated jurist of that time, Sergeant Snigge (later a  judge under James I.) for his opinion. “Question 9 —  Some of the more wealthy farmers in the parish have devised  a skilful mode by which all the trouble of executing this  Act (the 43rd of Elizabeth) might be avoided. They have  proposed that we shall erect a prison in the parish, and  then give notice to the neighbourhood, that if any persons  are disposed to farm the poor of this parish, they do give  in sealed proposals, on a certain day, of the lowest price  at which they will take them off our hands; and that they  will be authorised to refuse to any one unless he be shut up  in the aforesaid prison. The proposers of this plan conceive  that there will be found in the adjoining counties, persons,  who, being unwilling to labour and not possessing substance  or credit to take a farm or ship, so as to live without  labour, may be induced to make a very advantageous offer to  the parish. If any of the poor perish under the contractor’s  care, the sin will lie at his door, as the parish will have  done its duty by them. We are, however, apprehensive that  the present Act (43rd of Elizabeth) will not warrant a  prudential measure of this kind; but you are to learn that  the rest of the freeholders of the county, and of the  adjoining county of B, will very readily join in instructing  their members to propose an Act to enable the parish to  contract with a person to lock up and work the poor; and to  declare that if any person shall refuse to be so locked up  and worked, he shall be entitled to no relief. This, it is  hoped, will prevent persons in distress from wanting relief,  and be the means of keeping down parishes.” (R. Blakey: “The  History of Political Literature from the Earliest Times.”  Lond., 1855, Vol. II., pp. 84-85.) In Scotland, the  abolition of serfdom took place some centuries later than in  England. Even in 1698, Fletcher of Saltoun, declared in the  Scotch parliament, “The number of beggars in Scotland is  reckoned at not less than 200,000. The only remedy that I, a  republican on principle, can suggest, is to restore the old  state of serfdom, to make slaves of all those who are unable  to provide for their own subsistence.” Eden, l. c., Book I.,  ch. 1, pp. 60-61, says, “The decrease of villenage seems  necessarily to have been the era of the origin of the poor.  Manufactures and commerce are the two parents of our  national poor.” Eden, like our Scotch republican on  principle, errs only in this: not the abolition of  villenage, but the abolition of the property of the  agricultural labourer in the soil made him a proletarian,  and eventually a pauper. In France, where the expropriation  was effected in another way, the ordonnance of Moulins,  1571, and the Edict of 1656, correspond to the English  poor-laws.","Expropriation

They  trusted in the conditions of the time, that these  possessions would not be again taken from them, and bought,  therefore, some of the pieces of land lying near theirs, and  belonging to the poor, with the acquiescence of their  owners, and took some by force, so that they now were  cultivating widely extended domains, instead of isolated  fields. Then they employed slaves in agriculture and  cattle-breeding, because freemen would have been taken from  labour for military service. The possession of slaves  brought them great gain, inasmuch as these, on account of  their immunity from military service, could freely multiply  and have a multitude of children. Thus the powerful men drew  all wealth to themselves, and all the land swarmed with  slaves. The Italians, on the other hand, were always  decreasing in number, destroyed as they were by poverty,  taxes, and military service. Even when times of peace came,  they were doomed to complete inactivity, because the rich  were in possession of the soil, and used slaves instead of  freemen in the tilling of it.” (Appian: “Civil Wars,” I.7.)  This passage refers to the time before the Licinian  rogations. Military service, which hastened to so great an  extent the ruin of the Roman plebeians, was also the chief  means by which, as in a forcing-house, Charlemagne brought  about the transformation of free German peasants into serfs  and bondsmen.","Expropriation

The landlord, without regard to the hereditary tenant (a  category used in error here), now offers his land to the  highest bidder, who, if he is an improver, instantly adopts  a new system of cultivation. The land, formerly overspread  with small tenants or labourers, was peopled in proportion  to its produce, but under the new system of improved  cultivation and increased rents, the largest possible  produce is obtained at the least possible expense: and the  useless hands being, with this view, removed, the population  is reduced, not to what the land will maintain, but to what  it will employ. “The dispossessed tenants either seek a  subsistence in the neighbouring towns,” &c.

These letters originally appeared in  The Times. The English economists of course  explained the famine of the Gaels in 1847, by their  over-population. At all events, they “were pressing on their  food-supply.” The “clearing of estates,” or as it is called  in Germany, “Bauernlegen,” occurred in Germany especially  after the 30 years’ war, and led to peasant-revolts as late  as 1790 in Kursachsen.

After the conquest of Silesia he forced the  landlords to rebuild the huts, barns, etc., and to provide  the peasants with cattle and implements. He wanted soldiers  for his army and tax-payers for his treasury. For the rest,  the pleasant life that the peasant led under Frederick’s  system of finance and hodge-podge rule of despotism,  bureaucracy and feudalism, may be seen from the following  quotation from his admirer, Mirabeau: “Le lin fait donc une  des grandes richesses du cultivateur dans le Nord de  l’Allemagne. Malheureusement pour l’espèce humaine,  ce n’est qu’une ressource contre la misère et non un  moyen de bien-être.  Les impôts directs, les  corvées, les servitudes de tout genre,  écrasent le cultivateur allemand, qui paie encore des  impôts indirects dans tout ce qu’il achète....  et pour comble de ruine, il n’ose pas vendre ses productions  où et comme il le veut; il n’ose pas acheter ce dont  il a besoin aux marchands qui pourraient le lui livrer au  meilleur prix. Toutes ces causes le ruinent insensiblement,  et il se trouverait hors d’état de payer les  impôts directs à l’échéance sans  la filerie; elle lui offre une ressource, en occupant  utilement sa femme, ses enfants, ses servants, ses valets,  et lui-même; mais quelle pénible vie,  même aidée de ce secours.  En  été, il travaille comme un forçat au  labourage et à la récolte; il se couche  à 9 heures et se lève à deux, pour  suffire aux travaux; en hiver il devrait réparer ses  forces par un plus grand repos; mais il manquera de grains  pour le pain et les semailles, s’il se défait des  denrées qu’il faudrait vendre pour payer les  impôts. Il faut donc filer pour suppléer  à ce vide.... il faut y apporter la plus grande  assiduité.  Aussi le paysan se couche-t-il en hiver  à minuit, une heure, et se lève à cinq  ou six; ou bien il se couche à neuf, et se  lève à deux, et cela tous les jours de la vie  si ce n’est le dimanche. Ces excès de veille et de  travail usent la nature humaine, et de là vient  qu’hommes et femmes vieillissent beaucoup plutôt dans  les campagnes que dans les villes.”  (Mirabeau, l. c., t.III.  pp. 212 sqq.)","Expropriation

In April 1866, 18  years after the publication of the work of Robert Somers  quoted above, Professor Leone Levi gave a lecture before the  Society of Arts on the transformation of sheep-walks into  deer-forest, in which he depicts the advance in the  devastation of the Scottish Highlands. He says, with other  things: “Depopulation and transformation into sheep-walks  were the most convenient means for getting an income without  expenditure... A deer-forest in place of a sheep-walk was a  common change in the Highlands. The landowners turned out  the sheep as they once turned out the men from their  estates, and welcomed the new tenants — the wild beasts  and the feathered birds.... One can walk from the Earl of  Dalhousie’s estates in Forfarshire to John O’Groats, without  ever leaving forest land.... In many of these woods the fox,  the wild cat, the marten, the polecat, the weasel and the  Alpine hare are common; whilst the rabbit, the squirrel and  the rat have lately made their way into the country. Immense  tracts of land, much of which is described in the  statistical account of Scotland as having a pasturage in  richness and extent of very superior description, are thus  shut out from all cultivation and improvement, and are  solely devoted to the sport of a few persons for a very  brief period of the year.” The London Economist of  June 2, 1866, says, “Amongst the items of news in a Scotch  paper of last week, we read... ’One of the finest sheep  farms in Sutherlandshire, for which a rent of £1,200 a  year was recently offered, on the expiry of the existing  lease this year, is to be converted into a deer-forest.’  Here we see the modern instincts of feudalism ... operating  pretty much as they did when the Norman Conqueror...  destroyed 36 villages to create the New Forest.... Two  millions of acres... totally laid waste, embracing within  their area some of the most fertile lands of Scotland. The  natural grass of Glen Tilt was among the most nutritive in  the county of Perth. The deer-forest of Ben Aulder was by  far the best grazing ground in the wide district of  Badenoch; a part of the Black Mount forest was the best  pasture for black-faced sheep in Scotland. Some idea of the  ground laid waste for purely sporting purposes in Scotland  may be formed from the fact that it embraced an area larger  than the whole county of Perth. The resources of the forest  of Ben Aulder might give some idea of the loss sustained  from the forced desolations. The ground would pasture  15,000 sheep, and as it was not more than one-thirtieth part  of the old forest ground in Scotland ... it might, &c.,  ... All that forest land is as totally unproductive.... It  might thus as well have been submerged under the waters of  the German Ocean.... Such extemporised wildernesses or  deserts ought to be put down by the decided interference of  the Legislature.” ","Expropriation

Hence at the end of the 15th  and during the whole of the 16th century, throughout Western  Europe a bloody legislation against vagabondage. The fathers  of the present working class were chastised for their  enforced transformation into vagabonds and paupers.  Legislation treated them as “voluntary” criminals, and  assumed that it depended on their own good will to go on  working under the old conditions that no longer existed.","Bloody

The master can sell him,  bequeath him, let him out on hire as a slave, just as any  other personal chattel or cattle. If the slaves attempt  anything against the masters, they are also to be executed.  Justices of the peace, on information, are to hunt the  rascals down. If it happens that a vagabond has been idling  about for three days, he is to be taken to his birthplace,  branded with a red-hot iron with the letter V on the breast  and be set to work, in chains, in the  streets or at some other labour.  If the vagabond gives a  false birthplace, he is then to become the slave for life of  this place, of its inhabitants, or its corporation, and to  be branded with an S. All persons have the right to take  away the children of the vagabonds and to keep them as  apprentices, the young men until the 24th year, the girls  until the 20th. If they run away, they are to become up to  this age the slaves of their masters, who can put them in  irons, whip them, &c., if they like.

Neither is  it enough that they are compelled to sell it voluntarily.  The advance of capitalist production develops a  working class, which by education, tradition, habit, looks  upon the conditions of that mode of production as  self-evident laws of Nature. The organisation of the  capitalist process of production, once fully developed,  breaks down all resistance. The constant generation of a  relative surplus-population keeps the law of supply and  demand of labour, and therefore keeps wages, in a rut that  corresponds with the wants of capital. The dull compulsion  of economic relations completes the subjection of the  labourer to the capitalist. Direct force, outside economic  conditions, is of course still used, but only exceptionally.  In the ordinary run of things, the labourer can be left to  the “natural laws of production,” i.e., to his  dependence on capital, a dependence springing from, and  guaranteed in perpetuity by, the conditions of production  themselves. It is otherwise during the historic genesis  of capitalist production. The bourgeoisie, at its rise,  wants and uses the power of the state to “regulate” wages,  i.e., to force them within the limits suitable for  surplus-value making, to lengthen the working-day and to  keep the labourer himself in the normal degree of  dependence.

The subordination of labour to capital  was only formal — i.e., the mode of  production itself had as yet no specific capitalistic  character. Variable capital preponderated greatly over  constant.

3189,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch28.htm,"In the 16th century, the condition of the labourers had,  as we know, become much worse. The money wage rose, but not  in proportion to the depreciation of money and the  corresponding rise in the prices of commodities. Wages,  therefore, in reality fell. Nevertheless, the laws for  keeping them down remained in force, together with the  ear-clipping and branding of those “whom no one was willing  to take into service.” By the Statute of Apprentices 5  Elizabeth, c. 3, the justices of the peace were empowered to  fix certain wages and to modify them according to the time  of the year and the price of commodities. James I. extended  these regulations of labour also to weavers, spinners, and  all possible categories of workers.  George II. extended the laws  against coalitions of labourers to  manufactures. In the manufacturing period par  excellence, the capitalist mode of production had  become sufficiently strong to render legal regulation of  wages as impracticable as it was unnecessary; but the ruling  classes were unwilling in case of necessity to be without  the weapons of the old arsenal. Still, 8 George II. forbade  a higher day’s wage than 2s. 7½d. for journeymen tailors  in and around London, except in cases of general mourning;  still, 13 George III., c. 68, gave the regulation of the  wages of silk-weavers to the justices of the peace; still,  in 1706, it required two judgments of the higher courts to  decide, whether the mandates of justices of the peace as to  wages held good also for non-agricultural labourers; still,  in 1799, an act of Parliament ordered that the wages of the  Scotch miners should continue to be regulated by a statute  of Elizabeth and two Scotch acts of 1661 and 1671. How  completely in the meantime circumstances had changed, is  proved by an occurrence unheard-of before in the English  Lower House. In that place, where for more than 400 years  laws had been made for the maximum, beyond which wages  absolutely must not rise, Whitbread in 1796 proposed a legal  minimum wage for agricultural labourers. Pitt opposed this,  but confessed that the “condition of the poor was cruel.”  Finally, in 1813, the laws for the regulation of wages were  repealed. They were an absurd anomaly, since the capitalist  regulated his factory by his private legislation, and could  by the poor-rates make up the wage of the agricultural  labourer to the indispensable minimum. The provisions of the  labour statutes as to contracts between master and workman,  as to giving notice and the like, which only allow of a  civil action against the contract-breaking master, but on  the contrary permit a criminal action against the  contract-breaking workman, are to this hour (1873) in full  force. The barbarous laws against Trades’ Unions fell in  1825 before the threatening bearing of the proletariat.  Despite this, they fell only in part. Certain beautiful  fragments of the old statute vanished only in 1859. Finally,  the act of Parliament of June 29, 1871, made a pretence of  removing the last traces of this class of  legislation by legal recognition of  Trades’ Unions. But an act of Parliament of the same date  (an act to amend the criminal law relating to violence,  threats, and molestation), re-established, in point of fact,  the former state of things in a new shape. By this  Parliamentary escamotage the means which the labourers could  use in a strike or lock-out were withdrawn from the laws  common to all citizens, and placed under exceptional penal  legislation, the interpretation of which fell to the masters  themselves in their capacity as justices of the peace. Two  years earlier, the same House of Commons and the same Mr.  Gladstone in the well-known straightforward fashion brought  in a bill for the abolition of all exceptional penal  legislation against the working class. But this was never  allowed to go beyond the second reading, and the matter was  thus protracted until at last the “great Liberal party,” by  an alliance with the Tories, found courage to turn against  the very proletariat that had carried it into power. Not  content with this treachery, the “great Liberal party”   allowed the English judges, ever complaisant in the service  of the ruling classes, to dig up again the earlier laws  against “conspiracy,” and to apply them to coalitions of  labourers. We see that only against its will and under the  pressure of the masses did the English Parliament give up  the laws against Strikes and Trades’ Unions, after it had  itself, for 500 years, held, with shameless egoism, the  position of a permanent Trades’ Union of the capitalists  against the labourers.

All villagers were  forbidden to let rooms to single men and women; all the  latter were to be reported to the authorities and cast into  prison if they were unwilling to become servants, even if  they were employed at any other work, such as sowing seeds  for the peasants at a daily wage, or even buying and selling  corn.

3205,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch29.htm,"Now that we have considered the forcible creation  of a class of outlawed proletarians, the bloody discipline that turned  them into wage labourers, the disgraceful action of the State which employed  the police to accelerate the accumulation of capital by increasing the  degree of exploitation of labour, the question remains: whence came the  capitalists originally? For the expropriation of the agricultural population  creates, directly, none but the greatest landed proprietors. As far, however,  as concerns the genesis of the farmer, we can, so to say, put our hand  on it, because it is a slow process evolving through many centuries. The  serfs, as well as the free small proprietors, held land under very different  tenures, and were therefore emancipated under very different economic conditions.  In England the first form of the farmer is the bailiff, himself a serf.  His position is similar to that of the old Roman villicus, only  in a more limited sphere of action. During the second half of the 14th  century he is replaced by a farmer, whom the landlord provided with seed,  cattle and implements. His condition is not very different from that of  the peasant. Only he exploits more wage labour. Soon he becomes a metayer,  a half-farmer. He advances one part of the agricultural stock, the landlord  the other. The two divide the total product in proportions determined by  contract. This form quickly disappears in England, to give the place to  the farmer proper, who makes his own capital breed by employing wage labourers,  and pays a part of the surplus-product, in money or in kind, to the landlord  as rent. So long, during the 15th century, as the independent peasant and  the farm-labourer working for himself as well as for wages, enriched themselves  by their own labour, the circumstances of the farmer, and his field of production,  were equally mediocre. The agricultural revolution which commenced in the  last third of the 15th century, and continued during almost the whole of  the 16th (excepting, however, its last decade), enriched him just as speedily  as it impoverished the mass of the agricultural people.

To this was added in the  16th century a very important element. At that time the contracts for farms  ran for a long time, often for 99 years. The progressive fall in the value  of the precious metals, and therefore of money, brought the farmers golden  fruit. Apart from all the other circumstances discussed above, it lowered  wages. A portion of the latter was now added to the profits of the farm.  The continuous rise in the price of corn, wool, meat, in a word of all  agricultural produce, swelled the money capital of the farm without any  action on his part, whilst the rent he paid (being calculated on the old  value of money) diminished in reality.

In France, the régisseur, steward,  collector of dues for the feudal lords during the earlier part of the middle  ages, soon became an homme d'affaires, who by extortion, cheating, &c.,  swindled himself into a capitalist. These régisseurs themselves  were sometimes noblemen. E.g., “C'est li compte que messire Jacques  de Thoraine, chevalier chastelain sor Besançon rent és-seigneur  tenant les comptes à Dijon pour monseigneur le duc et comte de Bourgoigne,  des rentes appartenant à la dite chastellenie, depuis xxve jour  de décembre MCCCLIX jusqu'au xxviiie jour de décembre MCCCLX.”     (Alexis Monteil: “Traité de Matériaux Manuscrits etc.,” pp.  234, 235.) Already it is evident here how in all spheres of social life  the lion's share falls to the middleman. In the economic domain, e.g.,  financiers, stock-exchange speculators, merchants, shopkeepers skim the  cream; in civil matters, the lawyer fleeces his clients; in politics the  representative is of more importance than the voters, the minister than  the sovereign; in religion, God is pushed into the background by the “Mediator,”   and the latter again is shoved back by the priests, the inevitable middlemen  between the good shepherd and his sheep. In France, as in England, the  great feudal territories were divided into innumerable small homesteads,  but under conditions incomparably more favorable for the people. During  the 14th century arose the farms or terriers. Their number grew  constantly, far beyond 100,000. They paid rents varying from 1/12 to 1/5  of the product in money or in kind. These farms were fiefs, sub-fiefs,  &c., according the value and extent of the domains, many of them only  containing a few acres. But these farmers had rights of jurisdiction in  some degree over the dwellers on the soil; there were four grades. The  oppression of the agricultural population under all these petty tyrants  will be understood. Monteil says that there were once in France 160,000  judges, where today, 4,000 tribunals, including justices of the peace,  suffice.  ","Genesis

Anderson (not to be confounded with James Anderson), in his   “History of Commerce,” believe in the direct intervention of Providence.  We must still pause a moment on this element of primitive accumulation.  The thinning-out of the independent, self-supporting peasants not only  brought about the crowding together of the industrial proletariat, in the  way that Geoffrey Saint Hilaire explained the condensation of cosmical  matter at one place, by its rarefaction at another.  One does not perceive, when looking  at the large manufactories and the large farms, that they have originated  from the throwing into one of many small centres of production, and have  been built up by the expropriation of many small independent producers.  Nevertheless, the popular intuition was not at fault. In the time of Mirabeau,  the lion of the Revolution, the great manufactories were still called manufactures  réunies, workshops thrown into one, as we speak of fields thrown into one.

Those where a very large number of  labourers work, each separately and on his own account, are hardly considered;  they are placed at an infinite distance from the others. This is a great  error, as the latter alone make a really important object of national prosperity....  The large workshop (manufacture réunie) will enrich prodigiously  one or two entrepreneurs, but the labourers will only be journeymen, paid  more or less, and will not have any share in the success of the undertaking.  In the discrete workshop (manufacture separée), on the contrary, no one  will become rich, but many labourers will be comfortable; the saving and  the industrious will be able to amass a little capital, to put by a little  for a birth of a child, for an illness, for themselves or their belongings.  The number of saving and industrious labourers will increase, because they  will see in good conduct, in activity, a means of essentially bettering  their condition, and not of obtaining a small rise in wages that can never  be of any importance of the future, and whose sole result is to place men  in the position to live a little better, but only from day to day.... The  large workshops, undertakings of certain private persons who pay labourers  from day to day to work for their gain, may be able to put these private  individuals at their ease, but they will never be an object worth the attention  of governments. Discrete workshops, for the most part combined with cultivation  of small holdings, are the only free ones.”  The expropriation  and eviction of a part of the agricultural population not only set free  for industrial capital, the labourers, their means of subsistence, and material  for labour; it also created the home-market.

Formerly, the  peasant family produced the means of subsistence and the raw materials,  which they themselves, for the most part, consumed. These raw materials  and means of subsistence have now become commodities; the large farmer  sells them, he finds his market in manufactures. Yarn, linen, coarse woollen  stuffs — things whose raw materials had been within the reach of every  peasant family, had been spun and woven by it for its own use — were now  transformed into articles of manufacture, to which the country districts  at once served for markets.

Doubtless many small guild-masters, and yet more independent small artisans,  or even wage labourers, transformed themselves into small capitalists,  and (by gradually extending exploitation of wage labour and corresponding  accumulation) into full-blown capitalists. In the infancy of capitalist  production, things often happened as in the infancy of medieval towns,  where the question, which of the escaped serfs should be master and which  servant, was in great part decided by the earlier or later date of their  flight. The snail’s pace of this method corresponded in no wise with the  commercial requirements of the new world market that the great discoveries  of the end of the 15th century created. But the middle ages had handed  down two distinct forms of capital, which mature in the most different  economic social formations, and which before the era of the capitalist  mode of production, are considered as capital quand même  —  usurer’s  capital and merchant’s capital.

The capitalist may now be said to be the first owner  of all the wealth of the community, though no law has conferred on him  the right to this property... this change has been effected by the taking  of interest on capital ... and it is not a little curious that all the  law-givers of Europe endeavoured to prevent this by statutes, viz., statutes  against usury....

But, they all employ the power of the State, the concentrated and  organised force of society, to hasten, hot-house fashion, the process of  transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode,  and to shorten the transition.

But the coasting trade of India and between the islands,  as well as the internal trade of India, were the monopoly of the higher  employés of the company. The monopolies of salt, opium, betel and  other commodities, were inexhaustible mines of wealth. The employés  themselves fixed the price and plundered at will the unhappy Hindus. The  Governor-General took part in this private traffic. His favourites received  contracts under conditions whereby they, cleverer than the alchemists,  made gold out of nothing. Great fortunes sprang up like mushrooms in a  day; primitive accumulation went on without the advance of a shilling.  The trial of Warren Hastings swarms with such cases. Here is an instance.  A contract for opium was given to a certain Sullivan at the moment of his  departure on an official mission to a part of India far removed from the  opium district. Sullivan sold his contract to one Binn for £40,000;  Binn sold it the same day for £60,000, and the ultimate purchaser  who carried out the contract declared that after all he realised an enormous  gain.

Those sober virtuosi of Protestantism, the Puritans of New England, in  1703, by decrees of their assembly set a premium of £40 on every  Indian scalp and every captured red-skin: in 1720 a premium of £100  on every scalp; in 1744, after Massachusetts-Bay had proclaimed a certain  tribe as rebels, the following prices: for a male scalp of 12 years and  upwards £100 (new currency), for a male prisoner £105, for  women and children prisoners £50, for scalps of women and children  £50. Some decades later, the colonial system took its revenge on  the descendants of the pious pilgrim fathers, who had grown seditious in  the meantime.

The  treasures captured outside Europe by undisguised looting, enslavement,  and murder, floated back to the mother-country and were there turned into  capital.

The colonial  system with its maritime trade and commercial wars served as a forcing-house  for it. Thus it first took root in Holland. National debts, i.e.,  the alienation of the state – whether despotic, constitutional or republican – marked  with its stamp the capitalistic era. The only part of the so-called national  wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of modern peoples  is their national debt.  Hence, as a necessary consequence,  the modern doctrine that a nation becomes the richer the more deeply it  is in debt. Public credit becomes the credo of capital. And with  the rise of national debt-making, want of faith in the national debt takes  the place of the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which may not be forgiven.  ","Genesis

As with the stroke of an enchanter’s wand, it endows barren  money with the power of breeding and thus turns it into capital, without  the necessity of its exposing itself to the troubles and risks inseparable  from its employment in industry or even in usury. The state creditors actually  give nothing away, for the sum lent is transformed into public bonds, easily  negotiable, which go on functioning in their hands just as so much hard  cash would. But further, apart from the class of lazy annuitants thus created,  and from the improvised wealth of the financiers, middlemen between the  government and the nation – as also apart from the tax-farmers, merchants,  private manufacturers, to whom a good part of every national loan renders  the service of a capital fallen from heaven – the national debt has given  rise to joint-stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all  kinds, and to agiotage, in a word to stock-exchange gambling and the modern  bankocracy.

Hence the accumulation  of the national debt has no more infallible measure than the successive  rise in the stock of these banks, whose full development dates from the  founding of the Bank of England in 1694. The Bank of England began with  lending its money to the Government at 8%; at the same time it was empowered  by Parliament to coin money out of the same capital, by lending it again  to the public in the form of banknotes. It was allowed to use these notes  for discounting bills, making advances on commodities, and for buying the  precious metals. It was not long ere this credit-money, made by the bank  itself, became. The coin in which the Bank of England made its loans to  the State, and paid, on account of the State, the interest on the public  debt. It was not enough that the bank gave with one hand and took back  more with the other; it remained, even whilst receiving, the eternal creditor  of the nation down to the last shilling advanced. Gradually it became inevitably  the receptacle of the metallic hoard of the country, and the centre of  gravity of all commercial credit. What effect was produced on their contemporaries  by the sudden uprising of this brood of bankocrats, financiers, rentiers,  brokers, stock-jobbers, &c., is proved by the writings of that time,  e.g., by Bolingbroke’s.  ","Genesis

3257,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm,"  With the national debt arose an international credit system, which  often conceals one of the sources of primitive accumulation in this or  that people. Thus the villainies of the Venetian thieving system formed  one of the secret bases of the capital-wealth of Holland to whom Venice  in her decadence lent large sums of money. So also was it with Holland  and England. By the beginning of the 18th century the Dutch manufactures  were far outstripped. Holland had ceased to be the nation preponderant  in commerce and industry. One of its main lines of business, therefore,  from 1701-1776, is the lending out of enormous amounts of capital, especially  to its great rival England. The same thing is going on today between England  and the United States. A great deal of capital, which appears today in  the United States without any certificate of birth, was yesterday, in England,  the capitalised blood of children.  ","Genesis

3258,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm,"  As the national debt finds its support in the public revenue,  which must cover the yearly payments for interest, &c., the modern  system of taxation was the necessary complement of the system of national  loans. The loans enable the government to meet extraordinary expenses, without  the tax-payers feeling it immediately, but they necessitate, as a consequence,  increased taxes. On the other hand, the raising of taxation caused by the  accumulation of debts contracted one after another, compels the government  always to have recourse to new loans for new extraordinary expenses. Modern  fiscality, whose pivot is formed by taxes on the most necessary means of  subsistence (thereby increasing their price), thus contains within itself  the germ of automatic progression. Overtaxation is not an incident, but  rather a principle. In Holland, therefore, where this system was first  inaugurated, the great patriot, DeWitt, has in his “Maxims” extolled it  as the best system for making the wage labourer submissive, frugal, industrious,  and overburdened with labour. The destructive influence that it exercises  on the condition of the wage labourer concerns us less however, here, than  the forcible expropriation, resulting from it, of peasants, artisans, and  in a word, all elements of the lower middle class. On this there are not  two opinions, even among the bourgeois economists. Its expropriating efficacy  is still further heightened by the system of protection, which forms one  of its integral parts.

The  European states tore one another to pieces about the patent of this invention,  and, once entered into the service of the surplus-value makers, did not  merely lay under contribution in the pursuit of this purpose their own  people, indirectly through protective duties, directly through export premiums.  They also forcibly rooted out, in their dependent countries, all industry,  as, e.g., England did. with the Irish woollen manufacture. On the  continent of Europe, after Colbert’s example, the process was much simplified.  The primitive industrial capital, here, came in part directly out of the  state treasury. “Why,” cries Mirabeau, “why go so far to seek the cause  of the manufacturing glory of Saxony before the war? 180,000,000 of debts  contracted by the sovereigns!”  ","Genesis

Thousands of hands were suddenly required in these places, remote from  towns; and Lancashire, in particular, being, till then, comparatively thinly  populated and barren, a population was all that she now wanted. The small  and nimble fingers of little children being by very far the most in request,  the custom instantly sprang up of procuring apprentices from the  different parish workhouses of London, Birmingham, and elsewhere. Many,  many thousands of these little, hapless creatures were sent down into the  north, being from the age of 7 to the age of 13 or 14 years old. The custom  was for the master to clothe his apprentices and to feed and lodge them  in an “apprentice house” near the factory; overseers were appointed to  see to the works, whose interest it was to work the children to the utmost,  because their pay was in proportion to the quantity of work that they could  exact. Cruelty was, of course, the consequence. ... In many of the manufacturing  districts, but particularly, I am afraid, in the guilty county to which  I belong , cruelties the most heart-rending were practised  upon the unoffending and friendless creatures who were thus consigned  to the charge of master-manufacturers; they were harassed to the brink  of death by excess of labour ... were flogged, fettered and tortured in  the most exquisite refinement of cruelty; ... they were in many cases starved  to the bone while flogged to their work and ... even in some instances  ... were driven to commit suicide.... The beautiful and romantic valleys  of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lancashire, secluded from the public  eye, became the dismal solitudes of torture, and of many a murder. The  profits of manufacturers were enormous; but this only whetted the appetite  that it should have satisfied, and therefore the manufacturers had recourse  to an expedient that seemed to secure to them those profits without any  possibility of limit; they began the practice of what is termed “night-working,”  that is, having tired one set of hands, by working them throughout the  day, they had another set ready to go on working throughout the night;  the day-set getting into the beds that the night-set had just quitted,  and in their turn again, the night-set getting into the beds that the day-set  quitted in the morning.

The phrase, “labouring poor,” is  found in English legislation from the moment when the class of wage labourers  becomes noticeable. This term is used in opposition, on the one hand, to  the “idle poor,” beggars, etc., on the other to those labourers, who, pigeons  not yet plucked, are still possessors of their own means of labour. From  the Statute Book it passed into Political Economy, and was handed down  by Culpeper, J. Child, etc., to Adam Smith and Eden. After this, one can  judge of the good faith of the “execrable political cant-monger,” Edmund  Burke, when he called the expression, “labouring poor,” — “execrable political  cant.” This sycophant who, in the pay of the English oligarchy, played  the romantic laudator temporis acti against the French Revolution, just  as, in the pay of the North American Colonies, at the beginning of the  American troubles, he had played the Liberal against the English oligarchy,  was an out and out vulgar bourgeois. “The laws of commerce are the laws  of Nature, and therefore the laws of God.” (E.

3289,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm,"What does the primitive accumulation of capital, i.e.,  its historical genesis, resolve itself into? In so far as it is not immediate  transformation of slaves and serfs into wage labourers, and therefore a  mere change of form, it only means the expropriation of the immediate producers,  i.e., the dissolution of private property based on the labour of  its owner. Private property, as the antithesis to social, collective property,  exists only where the means of labour and the external conditions of labour  belong to private individuals. But according as these private individuals  are labourers or not labourers, private property has a different character.  The numberless shades, that it at first sight presents, correspond to the  intermediate stages lying between these two extremes. The private property  of the labourer in his means of production is the foundation of petty industry,  whether agricultural, manufacturing, or both; petty industry, again, is  an essential condition for the development of social production and of  the free individuality of the labourer himself. Of course, this petty mode  of production exists also under slavery, serfdom, and other states of dependence.  But it flourishes, it lets loose its whole energy, it attains its adequate  classical form, only where the labourer is the private owner of his own  means of labour set in action by himself: the peasant of the land which  he cultivates, the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso.  This mode of production presupposes parcelling of the soil and scattering  of the other means of production. As it excludes the concentration of these  means of production, so also it excludes cooperation, division of labour  within each separate process of production, the control over, and the productive  application of the forces of Nature by society, and the free development  of the social productive powers. It is compatible only with a system of  production, and a society, moving within narrow and more or less primitive  bounds. To perpetuate it would be, as Pecqueur rightly says, “to decree  universal mediocrity"". At a certain stage of development, it brings forth  the material agencies for its own dissolution. From that moment new forces  and new passions spring up in the bosom of society; but the old social  organisation fetters them and keeps them down. It must be annihilated;  it is annihilated. Its annihilation, the transformation of the individualised  and scattered means of production into socially concentrated ones, of the  pigmy property of the many into the huge property of the few, the expropriation  of the great mass of the people from the soil, from the means of subsistence,  and from the means of labour, this fearful and painful expropriation of  the mass of the people forms the prelude to the history of capital. It  comprises a series of forcible methods, of which we have passed in review  only those that have been epoch-making as methods of the primitive accumulation  of capital. The expropriation of the immediate producers was accomplished  with merciless Vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous,  the most sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private  property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated,  independent labouring individual with the conditions of his labour, is supplanted  by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally  free labour of others, i.e., on wage labour.  ","Historical

3290,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm,"As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed  the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the labourers are turned  into proletarians, their means of labour into capital, as soon as the capitalist  mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialisation  of labour and further transformation of the land and other means of production  into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as  well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form.  That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for  himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers. This expropriation  is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production  itself, by the centralisation of capital. One capitalist always kills many.  Hand in hand with this centralisation, or this expropriation of many capitalists  by few, develop, on an ever-extending scale, the cooperative form of the  labour process, the conscious technical application of science, the methodical  cultivation of the soil, the transformation of the instruments of labour  into instruments of labour only usable in common, the economising of all  means of production by their use as means of production of combined, socialised  labour, the entanglement of all peoples in the net of the world market,  and with this, the international character of the capitalistic regime.  Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital,  who usurp and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation,  grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation;  but with this too grows the revolt of the working class, a class always  increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organised by the very mechanism  of the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital  becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished  along with, and under it. Centralisation of the means of production and  socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible  with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder.

It forgets  that the latter not only is the direct antithesis of the former, but absolutely  grows on its tomb only. In Western Europe, the home of Political Economy,  the process of primitive accumulation is more of less accomplished. Here  the capitalist regime has either directly conquered the whole domain of  national production, or, where economic conditions are less developed,  it, at least, indirectly controls those strata of society which, though  belonging to the antiquated mode of production, continue to exist side  by side with it in gradual decay. To this ready-made world of capital,  the political economist applies the notions of law and of property inherited  from a pre-capitalistic world with all the more anxious zeal and all the  greater unction, the more loudly the facts cry out in the face of his ideology.  It is otherwise in the colonies. There the capitalist regime everywhere  comes into collision with the resistance of the producer, who, as owner  of his own conditions of labour, employs that labour to enrich himself, instead  of the capitalist. The contradiction of these two diametrically opposed  economic systems, manifests itself here practically in a struggle between  them. Where the capitalist has at his back the power of the mother-country,  he tries to clear out of his way by force the modes of production and appropriation  based on the independent labour of the producer. The same interest, which  compels the sycophant of capital, the political economist, in the mother-country,  to proclaim the theoretical identity of the capitalist mode of production  with its contrary, that same interest compels him in the colonies to make  a clean breast of it, and to proclaim aloud the antagonism of the two modes  of production. To this end, he proves how the development of the social  productive power of labour, co-operation, division of labour, use of machinery  on a large scale, &c.,   are impossible without the expropriation of  the labourers, and the corresponding transformation of their means of production  into capital. In the interest of the so-called national wealth, he seeks  for artificial means to ensure the poverty of the people. Here his apologetic  armor crumbles off, bit by bit, like rotten touchwood. It is the great  merit of E.G. Wakefield to have discovered, not anything new about the  Colonies  attempted  to manufacture capitalists artificially in the mother-country, so Wakefield’s  colonisation theory, which England tried for a time to enforce by Acts  of Parliament, attempted to effect the manufacture of wage-workers in the  Colonies.

But this  capitalist soul of theirs is so intimately wedded, in the head of the political  economist, to their material substance, that he christens them capital  under all circumstances, even when they are its exact opposite. Thus is  it with Wakefield. Further: the splitting up of the means of production  into the individual property of many independent labourers, working on their  own account, he calls equal division of capital.

The  essence of a free colony, on the contrary, consists in this — that the  bulk of the soil is still public property, and every settler on it therefore  can turn part of it into his private property and individual means of production,  without hindering the later settlers in the same operation.

Whence then is to come the internal market for capital? “No  part of the population of America is exclusively agricultural, excepting  slaves and their employers who combine capital and labour in particular  works. Free Americans, who cultivate the soil, follow many other occupations.  Some portion of the furniture and tools which they use is commonly made  by themselves. They frequently build their own houses, and carry to market,  at whatever distance, the produce of their own industry. They are spinners  and weavers; they make soap and candles, as well as, in many cases, shoes  and clothes for their own use. In America the cultivation of land is often  the secondary pursuit of a blacksmith, a miller or a shopkeeper.”   With such queer people as these, where is the “field of abstinence” for  the capitalists?  ","The

3308,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm,"The great beauty of capitalist production consists in this —  that it not only constantly reproduces the wage-worker as wage-worker,  but produces always, in proportion to the accumulation of capital, a relative  surplus-population of wage-workers. Thus the law of supply and demand of  labour is kept in the right rut, the oscillation of wages is penned within  limits satisfactory to capitalist exploitation, and lastly, the social  dependence of the labourer on the capitalist, that indispensable requisite,  is secured; an unmistakable relation of dependence, which the smug political  economist, at home, in the mother-country, can transmogrify into one of  free contract between buyer and seller, between equally independent owners  of commodities, the owner of the commodity capital and the owner of the  commodity labour. But in the colonies, this pretty fancy is torn asunder.  The absolute population here increases much more quickly than in the mother-country,  because many labourers enter this world as ready-made adults, and yet the  labour-market is always understocked. The law of supply and demand of labour  falls to pieces. On the one hand, the old world constantly throws in capital,  thirsting after exploitation and “abstinence”; on the other, the regular  reproduction of the wage labourer as wage labourer comes into collision with  impediments the most impertinent and in part invincible. What becomes of the   production of wage-labourers, supernumerary in proportion to the accumulation   of capital? The wage-worker of to-day is to-morrow an independent peasant, or   artisan, working for himself. He vanishes from the labour-market, but not into   the workhouse. This constant transformation of the wage-labourers into independent producers, who work for  themselves instead of for capital, and enrich themselves instead of the  capitalist gentry, reacts in its turn very perversely on the conditions  of the labour-market. Not only does the degree of exploitation of the wage labourer  remain indecently low. The wage labourer loses into the bargain, along with  the relation of dependence, also the sentiment   of dependence on the abstemious  capitalist. Hence all the inconveniences that our E. G. Wakefield pictures  so doughtily, so eloquently, so pathetically. The supply of wage labour,  he complains, is neither constant, nor regular, nor sufficient. “The supply  of labour is always not only small but uncertain.”   ","The

He depicts  the mass of the American people as well-to-do, independent, enterprising,  and comparatively cultured, whilst “the English agricultural labourer is  miserable wretch, a pauper.... In what country, except North America and  some new colonies, do the wages of free labour employed in agriculture much  exceed a bare subsistence for the labourer? ...

The fiasco was, of course, as complete as  that of Sir Robert Peel’s Bank Act. The stream of emigration was only diverted  from the English colonies to the United States. Meanwhile, the advance  of capitalistic production in Europe, accompanied by increasing Government  pressure, has rendered Wakefield’s recipe superfluous. On the one hand,  the enormous and ceaseless stream of men, year after year driven upon America,  leaves behind a stationary sediment in the east of the United States, the  wave of immigration from Europe throwing men on the labour-market there  more rapidly than the wave of emigration westwards can wash them away.  On the other hand, the American Civil War brought in its train a colossal  national debt, and, with it, pressure of taxes, the rise of the vilest  financial aristocracy, the squandering of a huge part of the public land  on speculative companies for the exploitation of railways, mines, &c.,  in brief, the most rapid centralisation of capital. The great republic  has, therefore, ceased to be the promised land for emigrant labourers.  Capitalistic  production advances there with giant strides, even though the lowering  of wages and the dependence of the wage-worker are yet far from being brought  down to the normal European level. The shameless lavishing of uncultivated  colonial land on aristocrats and capitalists by the Government, so loudly  denounced even by Wakefield, has produced, especially in Australia ,  in conjunction with the stream of men that the gold diggings attract, and  with the competition that the importation of English-commodities causes  even to the smallest artisan, an ample “relative surplus labouring population,”  so that almost every mail brings the Job’s news of a “glut of the Australia  labour-market,” and the prostitution in some places flourishes as wantonly  as in the London Haymarket.

Indeed there is no better introduction to the much more involved exposition in the first chapter of volume I of Capital as we now have it. Marx says in the Preface to the first edition of Capital (1867): “Beginnings are always difficult in all sciences. The understanding of the first chapter ... will therefore present the greatest difficulty. (Marx and Engels Collected Works, 1996, vol. 35, p.7). Especially in the English literature there is still a strong tendency to skip these initial ‘subtleties’. As opposed to this, in the years after the student movement, young Marxists in West Germany have tried to acquire a new understanding of the whole of Marx’s analyses, taking the value-form seriously. As there has been no language barrier, study of the additional versions of the fundamental part of the analysis as contained in such work as the Grundrisse, the Results of the Immediate Process of Production, the first edition of Capital, and the Notes on Adolph Wagner, all until recently closed to readers with no knowledge of German, was an important part of this work.

Vygodskii’s book on the history of Marx’s economic work, translated as The Story of a Great Discovery: How Wrote ‘Capital’, and most important of all Roman Rosdolsky’s The Making of Marx’s ‘Capital’, which has only just now appeared in English translation.

3357,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"In the simple expression of value the two types of commodities, linen and coat, obviously play two different roles. The linen is the commodity which expresses its value in the body of a commodity different from it, the coat. On the other hand, the commodity-type coat serves as the material in which value is expressed. The one commodity plays an active, the other a passive role. Now we say of the commodity which expresses its value in another commodity: its value is represented as relative value, or is in the relative value-form. As opposed to this, we say of the other commodity, here the coat, which serves as the material of the expression of value: it functions as equivalent to the first commodity or is in the equivalent form. ",The Value-Form
3358,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Without analysing the matter more deeply, the following points are clear from the start: ",The Value-Form
3359,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Relative value-form and equivalent form are moments of the same expression of value, which belong to one another and are reciprocally conditioning and inseparable. ",The Value-Form
3360,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"On the one hand, these two forms are mutually excluding or opposed extremes, i.e. poles, of the same expression of value. They are always distributed amongst different commodities, which the expression of value relates to one another. For example, I cannot express the value of linen in linen. ‘20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen’ is not an expression of value but simply expresses a definite quantity of the object of use, linen. The value of linen can thus only be expressed in another commodity (in andrer Ware), i.e. only relatively. The relative value-form of linen thus presupposes that that some other commodity confronts it in the equivalent form. On the other hand, this other commodity, here the coat, which figures as the equivalent of the linen is thus in equivalent form, and can not be at the same time in the relative value-form. This commodity does not express its value. It furnishes only the material for the expression of value in another commodity. ",The Value-Form
3361,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Certainly the expression: ‘20 yards of linen = 1 coat’ or ‘20 yards of linen are worth one coat’ also includes the converse: ‘1 coat = 20 yards of linen’ or ‘1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen’. But in doing this I must reverse the equation, in order to express the value of the coat relatively, and once I do this the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat. The same commodity therefore cannot make its appearance in the same expression of value at the same time in both forms. Rather, these exclude one another in a polar manner. ",The Value-Form

3367,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Here both, linen and coat, are at the same time in relative value-form and in equivalent form. But, nota bene, for two different persons and in two different expressions of value, which simply occur (ins Leben treten) at the same time. For A his linen is in relative value-form – because for him the initiative proceeds from his commodity – and the commodity of the other person, the coat, is in equivalent form. Conversely from the standpoint of B. Thus one and the same commodity never possess, even in this case, the two forms at the same time in the same expression of value. ",The Value-Form

3370,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"are not at all different. As regards the form, they are not only different but opposed. In expression 1 the value of the linen is expressed relatively. Hence it is in the relative value-form whilst at the same time the value of the coat is expressed as equivalent. Hence it is in the equivalent form. Now if I turn the expression 1 round I obtain expression 2. The commodities change positions and right away the coat is in the relative value-form, the linen in equivalent form. Because they have changed their respective positions in the same expression of value, they have changed value-form (die Wertform gewechselt). ",The Value-Form
3371,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Since it is the linen which is to express its value, the initiative proceeds from it. It enters into a relation with the coat, i.e. with some other commodity different from itself. This relation is a relation of equalisation (Gleichsetzung). The basis of the expression ‘20 yards of linen = 1 coat’ is in fact: linen = coat, which expressed in words simply means: ‘the commodity-type “coat” is of the same nature (ist gleicher Natur), the same substance as the “linen,” a type of commodity different from it’. We overlook that for the most part, because attention is absorbed by the quantitative relation, i.e. by the definite proportion, in which the one type of commodity is equated to the other. We forget that the magnitudes of different things are only quantitatively comparable after their reduction to the same unit. Only as expressions of the same unit are magnitudes with the same denominator (gleichnamige) and hence commensurable. In the above expression the linen thus relates to the coat as something of its own kind, or the coat is related to the linen as a thing of the same substance, as the same in essence (Wesensgleiches). The one is therefore quantitatively equated to the other. ",The Value-Form
3372,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The coat is only the same as the linen to the extent that both are values. Thus that the linen is related to the coat as to something of its own kind or that the coat as a thing of the same substance is equated to linen, expresses the fact that the coat counts in this relation as value. It is equated to the linen insofar as the latter is value as well. The relation of equality is thus a value-relation, but the value-relation is above all the expression of the value or the existence as value of the commodity which expresses its value. As use-value, or body of the commodity (Warenkörper), the linen is distinguished from the coat. But its existence as value comes to light, is expressed in a relation, in which another commodity-type, the coat, is equated to it or counts as the same in essence. ",The Value-Form
3373,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The coat is value only to the extent that it is the expression, in the form of a thing, of the human labour-power expended in its production and thus insofar as it is a jelly of abstract human labour – abstract labour, because abstraction is made from the definite useful concrete character of the labour contained in it, human labour, because the labour counts here only as expenditure of human labour-power as such. Thus the linen cannot relate (sich verhalten) to the coat as a thing having value, or cannot be related (bezogen werden) to the coat as value, without relating (bezogen werden) to it as a body whose sole substance consists in human labour. But as value this linen is a jelly of this same human labour. Within this relation the coat as a thing (Körper) thus represents the substances of value which it has in common with linen, i.e. human labour. Within this relation the coat thus counts only as shape of value (Gestalt von Wert), hence also as the form of the value (Wertgestalt) of the linen, as the sensible form of appearance of the value of the linen. Thus by means of the value-relation the value of the commodity is expressed in the use-value of another commodity, i.e. in the body of another commodity different from itself. ",The Value-Form
3374,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The 20 yards of linen are, however, not only value as such, i.e. a jelly of human labour, but value of a definite magnitude, i.e. a definite quantity of human labour is objectified in them. In the value relation of the linen to the coat the commodity-type coat is hence not only quantitatively equated to the linen as bodily form of value (Wertkörper) as such, i.e. as embodiment of human labour, but a definite quantity of this bodily form of value, 1 coat, not 1 dozen, etc, insofar as in 1 coat there is hidden precisely as much value-substance of human labour as in 20 yards of linen. ",The Value-Form
3375,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Thus through the relative value-expression the value of the commodity acquires, first, a form different from its own use-value. The use-form of this commodity is, e.g. linen. But it possesses its value-form in its relation of equality with the coat. Through this relation of equality the body of another commodity, sensibly different from it, becomes the mirror of its own existence as value (Wertsein), of its own character as value (Wertgestalt). In this way it gains an independent and separate value-form, different from its natural form. But second, as a value of definite magnitude, it is quantitatively measured by the quantitatively definite relation or the proportion in which it is equated to the body of the other commodity. ",The Value-Form
3376,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"As values all commodities are expressions of the same unit, of human labour, which count equally and are replaceable or substitutable for one another. Hence a commodity is only exchangeable with another commodity insofar as it possesses a form in which it appears as value. A body of the commodity is immediately exchangeable with another commodity insofar as its immediate form i.e. its own bodily or natural form, represents (vorstellt) value with regard to another commodity or counts as value-form (Wertgestalt). This property is possessed by the coat in the value-relation of the linen to the coat. The value of the linen would otherwise not be expressible in the thing which is the coat. Therefore that a commodity has equivalent form at all, means just this. Through its place in the value-expression its own natural form counts as the value-form for another commodity or it possesses the form of immediate exchangeability with another commodity. Therefore it does not need to take on (annehmen) a form different from its immediate natural form in order to appear as value for another commodity, to count as value and to act on it as value (auf sie als Wert zu wirken).

The opposed erroneous view springs from the following causes: ",The Value-Form
3378,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"First, the commodity ‘coat’, for example, which serves as material for the expression of value of linen is, within such an expression, also always quantitatively definite, like ‘1 coat’ and ‘not 12 coats’, etc. But why? Because the ‘20 yards of linen’ are expressed in their relative value expression of value not only as value as such, but at the same time are measured as a definite quantity of value. But that 1 coat and not 12 coats contains as much labour as 20 yards of linen and hence is equated with 20 yards of linen has absolutely nothing to do with this characteristic property of the commodity-type coat of being immediately exchangeable with the commodity-type linen. ",The Value-Form
3379,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Second, if ‘20 yards of linen’ as value of a definite magnitude are expressed in ‘1 coat’, then conversely the magnitude of value of ‘1 coat’ is also expressed in ‘20 yards of linen’, and thus similarly quantitatively measured, but only indirectly, through reversal of the expression, not insofar as the coat plays the role of the equivalent but rather insofar as it represents its own value relatively in the linen. ",The Value-Form
3380,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Third, we can also express the formula ‘20 yards of linen = 1 coat’ or ‘20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat’ in the following way: ",The Value-Form

Neither of the two commodities is hence set up in equivalent-form. Equivalent means here only something equal in magnitude, both things having been silently reduced in our heads to the abstraction value. ",The Value-Form
3383,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"a) First peculiarity of the equivalent form: use-value becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, of value. ",The Value-Form
3384,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The natural form of the commodity becomes the value-form. But, nota bene, this quid pro quo occurs for a commodity B (coat or wheat or iron, etc.) only within the value-relation to it, into which any other commodity A (linen, etc) enters, and only within this relation. In itself, considered in isolation, the coat, e.g., is only a useful thing, a use-value, just like the linen, and hence its coat-form is only the form of use-value (ist nur Form von Gebrauchswert) or natural form of a definite type of commodity. But since no commodity can relate to itself as equivalent and therefore also cannot make its own natural hide an expression of its own value, it must relate itself to another commodity as equivalent or make the natural hide of the body of another commodity its own value-form. ",The Value-Form
3385,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"This may be illustrated by the example of a measure, which is predicable of the bodies of commodities as bodies (den Warenkörpern als Warenkörpern zukommt) i.e. as use-values. A sugar-loaf, qua body (weil Körper), is heavy and hence has weight, but one cannot tell the weight of a sugar-loaf by looking or feeling (man kann keinen Zuckerhut seine Schwere ansehn oder anfühlen). Now we take different pieces of iron whose weight has been previously determined. The bodily form of the iron considered in itself is just as little the form of appearance of weight as that of the sugar-loaf. However in order to express the sugar-loaf as heaviness or weight, we put it into a weight-relation with iron. In this relation the iron counts as a body, which represents nothing but heaviness or weight. Hence quantities of iron serve as the measure of the weight of sugar and represent, with regard to the body of sugar, merely the form of heaviness (blosse Schweregestalt), form of appearance of heaviness. Iron plays this role only within the relation in which the sugar, or some other body whose weight is to be found, enters. Were both things not heavy they could not enter into this relation and hence the one could not serve as the expression of the weight of the other. If we throw both on the scale pan, we see in fact that they are, as weight, the same and hence in a definite proportion also of the same weight. Just as here the body of the iron represents, with regard to the sugar-loaf, simply heaviness, so in our expression of value the body of the coat represents, with regard to the linen, simply value. ",The Value-Form
3386,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"b) Second peculiarity of the equivalent form: concrete labour becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, abstract human labour ",The Value-Form
3387,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The coat counts in the expression of the value of the linen as the value-body, hence its bodily or natural form as value-form, i.e. therefore as embodiment of undifferentiated human labour, human labour as such (schlechthin). But the labour by which the useful thing which is the coat is made and by which it acquires a definite form, is not abstract human labour, human labour as such, but a definite useful, concrete type of labour – the labour of tailoring. The simple relative value-form requires (erheischt) that the value of a commodity, linen, for example, is expressed only in one single other type of commodity. Which the other type of commodity is, is however, for the simple value-form, completely irrelevant. Instead of the commodity-type ‘coat’ the value of the linen could have been expressed in wheat, or instead of wheat, in iron, etc. But whether in coat, wheat or iron, in every case the equivalent of linen counts as the body of value with regard to the linen, hence as embodiment of human labour as such. And in every case the definite bodily form of the equivalent, whether coat or wheat or iron, remains embodiment not of abstract human labour, but of a definite concrete useful type of labour, be it the labour of tailoring or of farming or of mining. The definite concrete useful labour, which produces the body of the commodity which is the equivalent must therefore, in the expression of value, always necessarily count as a definite form of realisation or form of appearance, i.e. of abstract human labour. The coat, for example, can only count as the body of value, hence as embodiment of human labour as such, in so far as the labour of tailoring counts as a definite form, in which human labour-power is expended or in which abstract human labour is realised. ",The Value-Form
3388,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Within the value-relation and the value expression included in it, the abstractly general counts not as a property of the concrete, sensibly real; but on the contrary the sensibly-concrete counts as the mere form of appearance or definite form of realisation of the abstractly general. The labour of tailoring, which, for example, hides in the equivalent ‘coat’, does not possess, within the value-expression of the linen, the general property of also being human labour. On the contrary. Being human labour counts as its essence (Wesen), being the labour of tailoring counts only as the form of appearance (Erscheinungsform) or definite form of realisation of this its essence. This quid pro quo is unavoidable because the labour represented in the product of labour only goes to create value insofar as it is undifferentiated human labour, so that the labour objectified in the value of the product is in no way distinguished from the labour objectified in the value of a different product. ",The Value-Form
3389,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"This inversion (Verkehrung) by which the sensibly-concrete counts only as the form of appearance of the abstractly general and not, on the contrary, the abstractly general as property of the concrete, characterises the expression of value. At the same time, it makes understanding it difficult. If I say: Roman Law and German Law are both laws, that is obvious. But if I say: Law (Das Recht), this abstraction (Abstraktum) realises itself in Roman Law and in German Law, in these concrete laws, the interconnection becoming mystical. ",The Value-Form
3390,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"g) Third peculiarity of the equivalent form: private labour becomes the form of its opposite, labour in immediately social form ",The Value-Form
3391,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Products of labour would not become commodities, were they not products of separate private labours carried on independently of one another. The social interconnection of these private labours exists materially, insofar as they are members of a naturally evolved social division of labour and hence, through their products, satisfy wants of different kinds, in the totality (Gesamtheit) of which the similarly naturally evolved system of social wants (naturwüchsiges System der gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisse) consists. This material social interconnection of private labours carried on independently of one another is however only mediated and hence is realised only through the exchange of their products. The product of private labour hence only has social form insofar as it has value-form and hence the form of exchangeability with other products of labour. It has immediately social form insofar as its own bodily or natural form is at the same time the form of its exchangeability with other commodities or counts as value-form for another commodity (anderer Ware). However, as we have seen, this only takes place for a product of labour when, through the value relation of other commodities to it, it is in equivalent-form or, with respect to other commodities, plays the role of equivalent. ",The Value-Form
3392,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The equivalent has immediately social form insofar as it has the form of immediate exchangeability with another commodity, and it has this form of immediate exchangeability insofar as it counts for another commodity as the body of value, hence as equal (als Gleiches). Therefore the definite useful labour contained in it also counts as labour in immediately social form, i.e. as labour which possesses the form of equality with the labour contained in another commodity. A definite, concrete labour like the labour of tailoring can only possess the form of equality with the labour of a different type contained in a commodity of a different kind, for example the linen, insofar as its definite form counts as the expression of something which really constitutes the equality of labours of different sorts or what is equal in those labours. But they are only equal insofar as they are human labour as such, abstract human labour, i.e. expenditure of human labour-power. Thus, as has already been shown, because the definite concrete labour contained in the equivalent counts as the definite form of realisation or form of appearance of abstract human labour, it possesses the form of equality with other labour, and hence, although it is private labour, like all other labour which produces commodities, it is nevertheless labour in immediately social form. Precisely because of this it is represented in a product that is immediately exchangeable with the other commodities. ",The Value-Form
3393,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The last two peculiarities of the equivalent-form set out in §§ b and g become still more comprehensible when we recur to the great theorist (Forscher) who for the first time analysed the value-form, like so many forms of thought, forms of society and forms of nature, and for the most part more happily than his modern successors, I mean Aristotle. ",The Value-Form
3394,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Aristotle clearly formulates first of all the fact that the money-form of the commodity is only the further developed shape (Gestalt) of the simple value-form, i.e. of the expression of value of a commodity in any other commodity, for he says: ",The Value-Form
3395,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,‘5 beds = 1 house’ (clinai pente anti oiciaς)  ‘does not differ’ from  ‘5 beds = such and such an amount of money’ (clinai pente anti ... oson ai pente clinai) ,The Value-Form
3396,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"He sees further that the value-relation, in which this expression of value hides, determines, for its part, the fact that the house is qualitatively equated with the bed and that these sensibly different things would not be able to be related to one another as commensurable magnitudes without such essential equality ‘Exchange’, he says, ‘cannot take place without equality, and equality cannot occur without commensurability.’ (out isothς mh oushς summetriaς).",The Value-Form
3397,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"But at this he pulls up short and ceases the further analysis of the value-form, ‘But it is in truth impossible (th men oun alhqeia adunaton) that things of such different sorts should be commensurable’, i.e. qualitatively equal.

3398,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Aristotle thus tells us himself just where his further analysis suffers shipwreck, namely, on the lack of the concept of value. What is that which is equal, i.e. the common substance, which the house represents for the bed in the expression of the value of the bed? Such a thing ‘cannot in truth exist’, says Aristotle. Why? With respect to the bed the house represents something which is equal (stellt ein Gleiches vor) insofar as it represents what in both, the bed and the house, is really equal. And that is – human labour. ",The Value-Form
3399,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"But the fact that in the form of commodity-values all labours are expressed as equal human labour and hence as counting equally (als gleichgeseltend) could not be read out of the value-form of commodities by Aristotle, because Greek society rested on slave labour and hence had the inequality of people and their labours as a natural basis. The secret of the expression of value, the equality of all labours and the fact that all labours count equally because and insofar as they are human labour as such can only be deciphered when the concept of human equality already possesses the fixity of a popular prejudice. But that is only possible in a society in which the commodity-form is the general form of the product of labour and thus also the relation of people to one another as possessors of commodities is the ruling social relation. The genius of Aristotle shines precisely in the fact that he discovers in the expression of value of commodities a relation of equality. Only the historical limit of the society in which he lived prevents him from finding out what, ‘in truth’, this relation of equality consists in. ",The Value-Form

3401,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The fact that the products of labour – such useful things as coat, linen, wheat, iron, etc. – are values, definite magnitudes of value and in general commodities, are properties which naturally pertain to them only in our practical interrelations (in unsrem Verkehr) and not by nature like, for example, the property of being heavy or being warming or nourishing. But within our practical interrelations, these things relate to one another as commodities. They are values, they are measurable as magnitudes of value, and their common property of being values puts them into a value-relation to one another. Now the fact that, for example, ‘20 yards of linen = 1 coat’ or ‘20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat’ only expresses the fact that: ",The Value-Form
3402,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,1. the different types of labour necessary for the production of these things count equally (gleichgelten) as human labour;  2. the fact that the quantity of labour expended in their production is measured according to definite social laws;  3. that tailors and weavers enter into a definite social relation of production. ,The Value-Form
3403,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"It is a definite social relation of the producers in which they equate (gleichsetzen) their different types of labour as human labour. It is not less a definite social relation of producers, in which they measure the magnitude of their labours by the duration of expenditure of human labour-power. But within our practical interrelations these social characters of their own labours appear to them as social properties pertaining to them by nature, as objective determinations (gegenständliche Bestimmungen) of the products of labour themselves, the equality of human labours as a value-property of the products of labour, the measure of the labour by the socially necessary labour-time as the magnitude of value of the products of labour, and finally the social relations of the producers through their labours appear as a value-relation or social relation of these things, the products of labour. Precisely because of this the products of labour appear to them as commodities, sensible-supersensible (sinnlich übersinnliche) or social things. Thus the impression on the optic nerve brought about by the light (Lichteindruck auf den Sehnerv) from something is represented, not as a subjective stimulation of the optic nerve itself, but as the objective form of a thing outside the eye. But in the case of seeing, light from a thing, from the external object, is in fact thrown upon another thing, the eye. It is a physical relation between physical things. As opposed to that the commodity-form and the value-relation of products of labour have absolutely nothing to do with their physical nature and the relations between things which springs from this. It is only the definite social relation of people (der Menschen) itself which here takes on for them the phantasmagoric form of a relation of things. Hence in order to find an analogy for this we must take flight into the cloudy region of the religious world. Here the products of the human head appear as independent figures (Gestalten) endowed with a life of their own and standing in a relation to one another and to people. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of the human hand. This I call the fetishism which clings to the products of labour as soon as they are produced as commodities and which is therefore inseparable from commodity-production. ",The Value-Form
3404,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Now this fetish-character emerges more strikingly in the equivalent-form than in the relative value-form. The relative value-form of a commodity is mediated, namely by its relation to another commodity. Through this value-form the value of the commodity is expressed as something completely distinct from its own sensible existence. At the same time it is inherent in this that existence as value (Wertsein) is a relation which is alien to the thing itself and hence that its value-relation to another thing can only be the form of appearance of a social relation hidden behind it. Conversely with the equivalent-form. It consists precisely in the fact that the bodily or natural form of a commodity counts immediately as the social form, as the value-form for another commodity. Therefore, within our practical interrelations, to possess the equivalent-form appears as the social natural property (gesellschaftliche Natureigenschaft) of a thing, as a property pertaining to it by nature, so that hence it appears to be immediately exchangeable with other things just as it exists for the senses (so wie es sinnlich da ist). But because within the value-expression of commodity A the equivalent-form pertains by nature to the commodity B it seems also to belong to the latter by nature outside of this relation. Hence, for example, the riddle (das Rätselhafte) of gold, that seems to possess, by nature, apart from its other natural properties, its colour, its specific weight, its non-oxydisability in air, etc., also the equivalent-form, or the social quality of being immediately exchangeable with all other commodities.

3416,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"then it becomes obvious at first glance that the money-form in nothing but the further development of the simple value-form of the commodity, and therefore of the simple commodity-form of the labour-product. Because the money-form is only the developed commodity-form it obviously springs from the simple commodity-form. Hence as soon as the latter is understood it only remains to consider the series of metamorphoses through which the simple commodity form ‘20 yards of linen = 1 coat’ must run in order to take on the shape (Gestalt annehmen) ‘20 yards of linen = 2 Pounds Sterling’. ",The Value-Form
3417,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The expression of value in the coat gives the linen a value-form by virtue of which it is distinguished simply as value from itself as use-value. This form also puts it only in relation to the coat, i.e. to some single type of commodity different from itself. But as value it is the same as all other commodities. Its value-form must hence also be a form which puts it into a relation of qualitative equality and quantitative proportionality to all other commodities – to the simple relative value-form of a commodity corresponds the singular equivalent-form of another commodity. Or the commodity, in which value is expressed, functions here only as singular equivalent. Thus the coat in the relative expression of value of linen possesses only the equivalent-form or the form of immediate exchangeability with relation to this single type of commodity, linen. ",The Value-Form
3418,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The simple value-form requires (bedingt) the value of one commodity to be expressed in only one commodity of another sort, though it does not matter which. It is therefore just as much a simple relative expression of value of the linen whether its value is expressed in iron or in wheat, etc., or when it is expressed in the commodity-type coat. Thus according to whether it enters into a value-relation with this or that type of commodity there arises different simple relative expressions of value of the linen. There exists the possibility that it has (Der Möglichkeit nach hat) just as many different simple expressions of value as there are different sorts of commodities. In fact, therefore, its complete relative expression of value consists not in an isolated simple relative expression of value but in the sum of its simple relative expressions of value. Thus we obtain: ",The Value-Form

3420,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,This series of simple relative expressions of value is in its nature constantly extendible or never concludes.

3421,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The value of a commodity, for example linen, is now represented in all other elements of the world of commodities. The body of each other commodity becomes the mirror of the value of the linen. Thus only now does this value itself appear truly as a jelly of undifferentiated human labour. For the labour which constitutes the value of the linen is now expressly represented as labour which counts equally with any other human labour whatever natural form at all it possesses and hence whether it is objectified in coat or wheat or iron or gold, etc. Hence by virtue of its value-form the linen now stands also in a social relation no longer to only a single other type of commodity, but to the world of commodities. As a commodity it is a citizen of this world. At the same time there is inherent in the endless series of its expressions the fact that the value of commodities is irrelevant with regard to each particular form of use-value in which it appears. ",The Value-Form
3422,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Each commodity – coat, tea, wheat, iron, etc. – counts in the expression of value of linen as equivalent and hence as a body of value. The definite natural form of each of these commodities is now a particular equivalent form beside many others. Similarly the manifold definite, concrete, useful types of labour contained in the different bodies of commodities now count as similarly many particular forms of realisation or appearance of human labour as such. ",The Value-Form
3423,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"First, the relative expression of value of linen is incomplete (unfertig) because the series which represents it never concludes. Second, it consists of a motley mosaic of different (verschiedenartige) expressions of value. Finally, if as must happen, the relative value of each commodity is expressed in this expanded form, the relative value-form of each commodity is an endless series of expressions of value, different from the relative value-form of each other commodity. The deficiencies of the expanded relative value-form are reflected in the equivalent-form corresponding to it. Since the natural form of each single type of commodity is here a particular equivalent-form beside innumerable other particular equivalent-forms there exist only limited equivalent-forms of which each excludes the other. Similarly the definite, concrete, useful type of labour contained in each particular commodity-equivalent is only a particular and thus not exhaustive form of appearance of human labour. The latter certainly possesses its complete or total form of appearance in the complete range (Gesamtumkreis) of those particular forms of appearance. But thus it possesses no unified form of appearance. ",The Value-Form
3424,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The total or expanded relative value-form consists however only in a sum of simple relative expressions of value or equations of the first form, like: ",The Value-Form

Therefore, if we reverse the series ‘20 yards of linen = 1 coat’ or ‘10 pounds of tea’ or ‘= etc.’, i.e. if we express the converse relation which is already contained ‘in itself’ (an sich), implicitly in the series, we obtain: ",The Value-Form
3429,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,The relative value-form now possesses a completely changed shape. All commodities express their value: ,The Value-Form

3431,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Their value-form is simple and common, i.e. general. The linen now counts for the bodies of all the different sorts of commodities as their common and general shape of value. The value-form of a commodity, i.e. the expression of its value in linen, now distinguishes the commodity not only as value from its own existence (Dasein) as a useful object, i.e. from its own natural form, but at the same time relates it as value to all other commodities, to all commodities as equal to it (als ihresgleichen). Hence in this value-form it possesses general social form. ",The Value-Form
3432,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Only through this general character does the value-form correspond to the concept of value (entspricht dem Wertbegriff). The value-form had to be a form in which commodities appear for one another as a mere jelly of undifferentiated, homogenous human labour, i.e. as expressions in the form of things of the same labour-substance. This is now attained. For they are all material expressions (Materiatur) of the same labour, of the labour contained in the linen or as the same material expression of labour, namely as linen. Thus they are qualitatively equated. ",The Value-Form

3438,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,The particular equivalent-form is now developed further to the general equivalent-form; or the commodity in equivalent-form is now general equivalent. By counting as the form of value of all other commodities the natural form of the body of the commodity linen is the form of its property of counting equally (Gleichgültigkeit) or immediate exchangeability with all elements of the world of commodities. Its natural form is therefore at the same time its general social form. ,The Value-Form
3439,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"For all other commodities, although they are products of the most different sorts of labour, the linen counts as the form of appearance of the labours contained in them, hence as the embodiment of homogenous undifferentiated human labour.

",The Value-Form
3440,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"For precisely this reason the private labour contained in linen also counts as labour which is immediately in general social form or in the form of equality with all other labours.

The initiative proceeds from the latter. ,The Value-Form
3442,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The simple relative value-form expresses the value of a commodity only in a single other type of commodity, no matter in which. The commodity thus only acquires value-form in distinction from its own use-value form or natural form. Its equivalent also acquires only the singular equivalent-form. The expanded relative value-form expresses the value of a commodity in all other commodities. Hence the latter acquire the form of many particular equivalents or particular equivalent-form. Finally, the world of commodities gives itself a unified, general, relative value-form, by excluding from itself one single type of commodity in which all other commodities express their value in common. Thereby the excluded commodity becomes general equivalent or the equivalent-form becomes the general equivalent-form. ",The Value-Form
3443,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,The polar opposition or the inseparable interconnection (Zusammengehörigkeit) and at the same time constant exclusion of relative value-form and equivalent-form implies: ,The Value-Form

According to whether the same equation is read forwards or backwards, each of the two commodities in the extreme positions (Warenextreme) like linen and coat, are similarly now in the relative value-form, now in the equivalent. At this point it still takes some effort to hold fast to the polar opposition. ",The Value-Form
3447,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"In form II only one type of commodity at a time can totally expand its relative value, i.e. it itself possesses expanded relative value-form only because and insofar as all other commodities are in the equivalent-form with regard to it.

3448,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Finally, in form III the world of commodities possesses general social relative value-form only because and insofar as all the commodities belonging to it are excluded from the equivalent-form or the form of immediate exchangeability. Conversely, the commodity which is in the general equivalent form or figures as general equivalent is excluded from the unified and hence general relative value-form of the world of commodities. If the linen – i.e. any commodity in general equivalent-form – were also to participate at the same time in the general relative value-form, then it would have had to have been related to itself as equivalent. We then obtain: ",The Value-Form

In order to express the relative value of the general equivalent, we must reverse form III. It does not possess any relative value-form in common with other commodities; rather, its value expresses itself relatively in the endless series of the bodies of all other commodities. Thus the expanded relative value-form or form II now appears as the specific relative value-form of the commodity which plays the role of the general equivalent. ",The Value-Form
3451,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The general equivalent-form is a form of value as such. It can therefore pertain to any commodity, but always only by exclusion from all other commodities. ",The Value-Form
3452,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"However the mere distinction in form between form II and form III already points to something peculiar, which does not distinguish forms I and II. This is that in the expanded value-form (form II) one commodity excludes all the others in order to express its own value in them. This exclusion can be a purely subjective process, for example a process traced out by the possessor of linen (z.B ein Prozess des Leinwandbesitzers) who assesses the value of his own commodity in many other commodities. As opposed to this a commodity is in general equivalent-form (form III) only because and insofar as it itself is excluded as equivalent by all other commodities. The exclusion is here an objective (objektiver) process independent of the excluded commodity. Hence in the historical development of the value-form the general equivalent-form may pertain now to this now to that commodity in turn. But a commodity never functions in fact (wirklich) as general equivalent except insofar as its exclusion and hence its equivalent-form is a result of an objective social process. ",The Value-Form
3453,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"The general value-form is the developed value-form and hence the developed commodity-form. The materially quite different products of labour cannot possess the finished commodity-form, and hence also cannot function in the process of exchange as a commodity, without being represented as expressions in the form of things (dingliche Ausdrüche) of the same equal human labour. That means that in order to acquire the finished commodity-form they must acquire the unified general relative value-form. But they can only acquire this unified relative value-form by excluding from its own series a definite type of commodity as general equivalent. And it is only from the moment when this exclusion is definitely limited to a specific type of commodity that the unified relative value-form has won objective stability and general social validity. ",The Value-Form
3454,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Now the specific type of commodity with whose natural form the equivalent form coalesces (verwächst) socially becomes the money-commodity or functions as money. It specific social function and hence its social monopoly becomes the playing of the role of general equivalent within the world of commodities. A definite commodity, gold, has historically conquered this privileged place amongst the commodities which figure in form II as particular equivalents of linen and in form III express commonly (gemeinsam ausdrücken) their relative value in linen. Hence, if we put in form III the commodity gold in the place of the commodity linen, we obtain: ",The Value-Form
3455,https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm,"Essential changes occur at the transition from form I to form II and from form II to form III. As opposed to this, form IV is distinguished from form III by nothing except the fact that now gold instead of linen possesses the general equivalent-form. Gold remains in form IV what linen was in form III – general equivalent. The progress consists only in the fact that the form of immediate general exchangeability or the general equivalent-form has now, by virtue of social custom, definitely coalesced with the specific natural form of the body of the commodity gold. Gold confronts the other commodities as money only because it already confronted them before as a commodity. Like all other commodities it also functions as equivalent, either as singular equivalent in isolated acts of exchange, or as particular equivalent beside other commodity-equivalents. Little by little it functioned in narrower or wider circles as general equivalent. Once it has conquered the monopoly of this position in the expression of value of the world of commodities it becomes the money-commodity (wird es Geldware), and from the moment when it has already become the money-commodity, form IV distinguishes itself from form III, or the general form of value is transformed into the money-form.

It is now only a matter of this exclusion winning an objectively (objektiv) social consistency and general validity, and hence does not concern different commodities in turn nor possesses a merely local reach (Tragweite) in only particular areas of the world of commodities. The difficulty in the concept of the money-form is limited to comprehending the general equivalent-form as such, form III.

The latter is obviously the scientifically correct method. The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation  and conception. Along the first path the full conception was evaporated to yield an abstract determination; along the second, the abstract determinations lead towards a reproduction of the concrete by way of thought.”   ",Economic Works
